TI  - Markov chain evaluation of acute postoperative pain transition states.

AB  - Previous investigations on acute postoperative pain dynamicity have focused on
      daily pain assessments, and so were unable to examine intraday variations in
      acute pain intensity. We analyzed 476,108 postoperative acute pain intensity
      ratings, which were clinically documented on postoperative days 1 to 7 from 8346 
      surgical patients using Markov chain modeling to describe how patients are likely
      to transition from one pain state to another in a probabilistic fashion. The
      Markov chain was found to be irreducible and positive recurrent, with no
      absorbing states. Transition probabilities ranged from 0.0031, for the transition
      from state 10 to state 1, to 0.69 for the transition from state 0 to state 0. The
      greatest density of transitions was noted in the diagonal region of the
      transition matrix, suggesting that patients were generally most likely to
      transition to the same pain state as their current state. There were also
      slightly increased probability densities in transitioning to a state of asleep or
      0 from the current state. An examination of the number of steps required to
      traverse from a particular first pain score to a target state suggested that
      overall, fewer steps were required to reach a state of 0 (range 6.1-8.8 steps) or
      asleep (range 9.1-11) than were required to reach a mild pain intensity state.
      Our results suggest that using Markov chains is a feasible method for describing 
      probabilistic postoperative pain trajectories, pointing toward the possibility of
      using Markov decision processes to model sequential interactions between pain
      intensity ratings, and postoperative analgesic interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Consensus indicates that a comprehensive,multimodal, holistic
      approach is foundational to the practice of acute pain medicine (APM),but lack of
      uniform, evidence-based clinical pathways leads to undesirable variability
      throughout U. S. healthcare systems. Acute pain studies are inconsistently
      synthesized to guide educational programs. Advanced practice techniques involving
      regional anesthesia assume the presence of a physician-led, multidisciplinary
      acute pain service,which is often unavailable or inconsistently applied.This
      heterogeneity of educational and organizational standards may result in
      unnecessary patient pain and escalation of healthcare costs. METHODS: A
      multidisciplinary panel was nominated through the APM Shared Interest Group of
      the American Academy of Pain Medicine. The panel met in Chicago, IL, in July
      2014, to identify gaps and set priorities in APM research and education. RESULTS:
      The panel identified three areas of critical need: 1) an open-source acute pain
      data registry and clinical support tool to inform clinical decision making and
      resource allocation and to enhance research efforts; 2) a strong professional APM
      identity as an accredited subspecialty; and 3) educational goals targeted toward 
      third-party payers,hospital administrators, and other key stake holders to convey
      the importance of APM. CONCLUSION: This report is the first step in a 3-year
      initiative aimed at creating conditions and incentives for the optimal provision 
      of APM services to facilitate and enhance the quality of patient recovery after
      surgery, illness, or trauma. The ultimate goal is to reduce the conversion of
      acute pain to the debilitating disease of chronic pain.

AB  - Older adults are at an increased risk to develop frequent and prolonged pain.
      Emerging evidence proposes a link between immune changes and pain, which is
      consistent with the inflammation theory of aging and the increased incidence of
      age-related diseases. This study tested the hypothesis that older adults show
      greater immune responses to experimental pain compared to younger individuals.
      Study subjects (8 younger and 9 older healthy adults) underwent 3 experimental
      sessions using well-validated human experimental pain models: the cold pressor
      task (CPT), focal heat pain (FHP), and a non-painful thermal control. Blood was
      collected through an indwelling catheter at baseline and 3, 15, 30, 45, 60, and
      90 min post-stimuli administration. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha IL-6
      and IL-8) peaked at the same time points for both groups, with greater elevations
      among older subjects for TNF-alpha and IL-8 in both pain models and elevations in
      IL-6 only for CPT. Anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) generally 
      peaked later for the older subjects, with increased elevations for FHP but not
      the CPT. These data are consistent with the assertion that age-related immune
      system dysregulation may account for the increased prevalence of pain in older
      adults.

TI  - Time to Onset of Sustained Postoperative Pain Relief (SuPPR) - Evaluation of a
      New Systems-Level Metric for Acute Pain Management.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prior work on postoperative pain trajectories have examined pain
      score changes over time using daily averages of pain scores. However, little is
      known about the time required until patients consistently report minimal
      postoperative pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort
      study of surgical case data from 7293 adult patients to examine the impact of
      age, gender, and the type of surgery on the time to sustained postoperative pain 
      relief (SuPPR). We defined SuPPR as the time required until a patient reports the
      first of multiple (2, 3, 4, or 5 sequential measurements; e.g., SuPPR-2, SuPPR-3,
      etc.), uninterrupted, mild pain scores (</=4/10). RESULTS: Overall, SuPPR times
      ranged from 3 minutes for SuPPR-2 and 9 minutes for SuPPR-5 to 160.1 hour for
      SuPPR-2 and 183.1 hour for SuPPR-5. For the SuPPR-2 outcome, the median time to
      event was 10.9 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 3-26.1 h) after surgery. For the
      SuPPR-5 outcomes, the median time to event was 31.5 hours (IQR, 17.8-54.2 h)
      after surgery. The peak median difference between two sequential SuPPR
      definitions was between SuPPR-3 and SuPPR-2 at 9 hours, with subsequent decreases
      to 6.5 hours between SuPPR-4 and SuPPR-3, and 5.2 hours between SuPPR-5 and
      SuPPR-4. There were statistically different differences across SuPPR 2 through 5 
      definitions by age, gender, and type of surgery. DISCUSSION: Although additional 
      analyses are necessary, SuPPR may represent a novel method for evaluating acute
      pain service performance.

      Clinical Data with Machine Learning Algorithms to Forecast Acute Postoperative
      Pain.
PG  - 1386-401
LID - 10.1111/pme.12713 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given their ability to process highly dimensional datasets with
      hundreds of variables, machine learning algorithms may offer one solution to the 
      vexing challenge of predicting postoperative pain. METHODS: Here, we report on
      the application of machine learning algorithms to predict postoperative pain
      outcomes in a retrospective cohort of 8,071 surgical patients using 796 clinical 
      variables. Five algorithms were compared in terms of their ability to forecast
      moderate to severe postoperative pain: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
      Operator (LASSO), gradient-boosted decision tree, support vector machine, neural 
      network, and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), with logistic regression included for
      baseline comparison. RESULTS: In forecasting moderate to severe postoperative
      pain for postoperative day (POD) 1, the LASSO algorithm, using all 796 variables,
      had the highest accuracy with an area under the receiver-operating curve (ROC) of
      0.704. Next, the gradient-boosted decision tree had an ROC of 0.665 and the k-NN 
      algorithm had an ROC of 0.643. For POD 3, the LASSO algorithm, using all
      variables, again had the highest accuracy, with an ROC of 0.727. Logistic
      regression had a lower ROC of 0.5 for predicting pain outcomes on POD 1 and 3.
      CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms, when combined with complex and
      heterogeneous data from electronic medical record systems, can forecast acute
      postoperative pain outcomes with accuracies similar to methods that rely only on 
      variables specifically collected for pain outcome prediction.

LID - 10.2196/jmir.3769 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread popularity of social media, little is known
      about the extent or context of pain-related posts by users of those media.
      OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the type, context, and dissemination of
      pain-related tweets. METHODS: We used content analysis of pain-related tweets
      from 50 cities to unobtrusively explore the meanings and patterns of
      communications about pain. Content was examined by location and time of day, as
      well as within the context of online social networks. RESULTS: The most common
      terms published in conjunction with the term "pain" included feel (n=1504), don't
      (n=702), and love (n=649). The proportion of tweets with positive sentiment
      ranged from 13% in Manila to 56% in Los Angeles, CA, with a median of 29% across 
      cities. Temporally, the proportion of tweets with positive sentiment ranged from 
      24% at 1600 to 38% at 2400, with a median of 32%. The Twitter-based social
      networks pertaining to pain exhibited greater sparsity and lower connectedness
      than did those social networks pertaining to common terms such as apple,
      Manchester United, and Obama. The number of word clusters in proportion to node
      count was greater for emotion terms such as tired (0.45), happy (0.43), and sad
      (0.4) when compared with objective terms such as apple (0.26), Manchester United 
      (0.14), and Obama (0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that
      pain-related tweets carry special characteristics reflecting unique content and
      their communication among tweeters. Further work will explore how geopolitical
      events and seasonal changes affect tweeters' perceptions of pain and how such
      perceptions may affect therapies for pain.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of age, sex, and type of
      surgery on postoperative pain trajectories derived in a clinical setting from
      pain assessments in the first 24 hours after surgery. This study is a
      retrospective cohort study using a large electronic medical records system to
      collect and analyze surgical case data. The sample population included adult
      patients undergoing nonambulatory nonobstetric surgery in a single institution
      over a 1-year period. Analyses of postoperative pain trajectories were performed 
      using a linear mixed-effects model. Pain score observations (91,708) from 7293
      patients were included in the statistical analysis. On average, the pain score
      decreased about 0.042 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.044 to -0.040) points on 
      the numerical rating scale (NRS) per hour after surgery for the first 24
      postoperative hours. The pain score reported by male patients was approximately
      0.27 (95% CI: -0.380 to -0.168) NRS points lower than that reported by females.
      Pain scores significantly decreased over time in all age groups, with a slightly 
      more rapid decrease for younger patients. Pain trajectories differed by anatomic 
      location of surgery, ranging from -0.054 (95% CI: -0.062 to -0.046) NRS units per
      hour for integumentary and nervous surgery to -0.104 (95% CI: -0.110 to -0.098)
      NRS units per hour for digestive surgery, and a positive trajectory (0.02 [95%
      CI: 0.016 to 0.024] NRS units per hour) for musculoskeletal surgery. Our data
      support the important role of time after surgery in considering the influence of 
      biopsychosocial and clinical factors on acute postoperative pain.

TI  - Sex differences in the incidence of severe pain events following surgery: a
      review of 333,000 pain scores.
PG  - 1390-404
LID - 10.1111/pme.12498 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Prior work has not addressed sex differences in the
      incidence of severe postoperative pain episodes. The goal of this study was to
      examine sex differences in clinical postoperative pain scores across an array of 
      surgical procedures using direct comparisons of numeric rating scale pain scores 
      as well as using the incidence of severe pain events (SPEs). DESIGN/SETTING:
      Retrospective cohort study of over 300,000 clinical pain score observations
      recorded from adult patients undergoing nonambulatory surgery at a tertiary care 
      academic medical center over a 1-year period. METHODS/PATIENTS: To test the
      hypothesis that the number of SPE on postoperative day (POD) 1 differed by sex
      after controlling for procedure, we calculated Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics
      of sex by count of SPE, controlling for type of surgery. ASSESSMENT
      TOOLS/OUTCOMES: Pain scores were collected from clinical nursing records where
      they were documented using the numeric rating scale. RESULTS: In female patients,
      10,989 (25.09%) of 43,806 POD 1 pain scores were considered SPE compared with
      10,786 (22.45%) of 48,055 POD 1 pain scores in male patients. This produced an
      overall odds ratio of 1.16 (99% confidence interval 1.11-1.20) for females vs
      males to report an SPE for a pain score on POD 1. Estimates of the odds that a
      given pain observation represents an SPE for female vs male patients after
      controlling for type of surgery yielded an odds ratio of 1.14 (99% confidence
      interval, 1.10-1.19). CONCLUSION: Female patients experience greater mean pain
      scores, as well as a higher incidence of SPE, on POD 1 for a variety of surgical 
      procedures.

AB  - Although prior work has investigated the interplay between demographic and
      intrasurvey correlations of Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers 
      and Systems (HCAHPS) scores, these prior studies have not included geospatial
      analyses, or analyses that take into account location effects. Here, we report
      the results of a geospatial analysis (not equivalent to simple geographical
      analysis) of patient experience scores pertaining to pain. HCAHPS data collected 
      in 2011 were examined to test the hypothesis that HCAHPS patient experience with 
      pain management (PEPM) scores were geospatially distributed throughout the United
      States using Moran's Index, which measures the association between PEPM scores
      and hospital location. After limiting the dataset to hospitals in the continental
      United States with nonzero HCAHPS response rates, 3645 hospitals were included in
      the analyses. "Always" responses were geospatially clustered amongst the analyzed
      hospitals. Clustering was significant in all distances tested from 10 to 5000km
      (P<0.0001). We identified 6 demarcated groups of hospitals. Taken together, these
      results strongly suggest a regional geographic effect on PEPM scores. These
      results may carry policy implications for U.S. hospitals with regard to acute
      pain outcomes. Further analyses will be necessary to evaluate policy explanations
      and implications of the regional geographic differences in PEPM results.

AB  - The American Academy of Pain Medicine and the American Society for Regional
      Anesthesia have recently focused on the evolving practice of acute pain medicine.
      There is increasing recognition that the scope and practice of acute pain
      therapies must extend beyond the subacute pain phase to include pre-pain and
      pre-intervention risk stratification, resident and fellow education in regional
      anesthesia and multimodal analgesia, as well as a deeper understanding of the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms that are integral to the variability observed among
      individual responses to nociception. Acute pain medicine is also being
      established as a vital component of successful systems-level acute pain
      management programs, inpatient cost containment, and patient satisfaction scores.
      In this review, we discuss the evolution and practice of acute pain medicine and 
      we aim to facilitate further discussion on the evolution and advancement of this 
      field as a subspecialty of anesthesiology.

LID - 10.1111/pme.12287 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this project was to explore the association between
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) pain scores recorded within the first and second
      hour of the end of surgery with maximum and median pain scores recorded on
      postoperative days (PODs) 1 through 5. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective
      cohort study of clinically documented pain scores in a mixed surgical population.
      SETTING: This study was set in a single tertiary-care teaching hospital over a
      1-year time period. PATIENTS: All patients were adult patients undergoing a
      single, non-ambulatory, non-obstetric surgical procedure. MEASURES: Pain scores, 
      measured using the numerical rating scale, from PODs 0 through 5 were obtained
      from an integrated data repository. Kendall's Tau-b correlations were then
      calculated between maximum pain scores occurring within each of the two PACU time
      periods and maximum and median pain scores in each of the five ensuing PODs.
      RESULTS: A total of 349,797 pain scores from 8,332 patients were reviewed.
      Correlations between maximum pain score by time period demonstrated a significant
      and high correlation at Tau-b = 0.86, between 1-hour PACU pain scores and 2-hour 
      PACU pain scores. However, the correlation of maximum pain scores recorded in the
      PACU with those recorded on PODs 1 through 5 was significantly lower, ranging
      from 0.19 to 0.27. The correlation of maximum PACU pain score with median pain
      scores recorded on PODs 1 through 5 ranged from 0.22 to 0.29. The correlation
      structures of the PODs 1 through 5 median pain scores may be consistent with an
      autoregressive pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Maximum scores measured within the PACU
      likely reflect a set of circumstances distinct from those experienced on PODs 1
      through 5.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the field of acute pain medicine (APM) has witnessed
      a surge in its development, and pain has begun to be recognized not merely as a
      symptom, but as an actual disease process. This development warrants increased
      education of residents both in the performance of regional anesthesia as well as 
      in the disease course of acute pain and the biopsychosocial mechanisms that
      define interindividual variability. REVIEW SUMMARY: We reviewed the organization 
      and function of the modern APM program. Following a discussion of the
      nomenclature of acute pain-related practices, we discuss the historical evolution
      and modern role of APM teams, including the use of traditional, as well as
      complementary and alternative, therapies for treating acute pain. Staffing and
      equipment requirements are also evaluated, in addition to the training
      requirements for achieving expertise in APM. Lastly, we briefly explore future
      considerations related to the essential role and development of APM. CONCLUSION: 
      The scope and practice of APM must be expanded to include
      pre-pain/pre-intervention risk stratification and extended through the phase of
      subacute pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project was to determine whether machine-learning 
      classifiers could predict which patients would require a preoperative acute pain 
      service (APS) consultation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: University
      teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: The records of 9,860 surgical patients posted
      between January 1 and June 30, 2010 were reviewed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Request for 
      APS consultation. A cohort of machine-learning classifiers was compared according
      to its ability or inability to classify surgical cases as requiring a request for
      a preoperative APS consultation. Classifiers were then optimized utilizing
      ensemble techniques. Computational efficiency was measured with the central
      processing unit processing times required for model training. Classifiers were
      tested using the full feature set, as well as the reduced feature set that was
      optimized using a merit-based dimensional reduction strategy. RESULTS:
      Machine-learning classifiers correctly predicted preoperative requests for APS
      consultations in 92.3% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 91.8-92.8) of all surgical
      cases. Bayesian methods yielded the highest area under the receiver operating
      curve (0.87, 95% CI 0.84-0.89) and lowest training times (0.0018 seconds, 95% CI,
      0.0017-0.0019 for the NaiveBayesUpdateable algorithm). An ensemble of
      high-performing machine-learning classifiers did not yield a higher area under
      the receiver operating curve than its component classifiers. Dimensional
      reduction decreased the computational requirements for multiple classifiers, but 
      did not adversely affect classification performance. CONCLUSIONS: Using
      historical data, machine-learning classifiers can predict which surgical cases
      should prompt a preoperative request for an APS consultation. Dimensional
      reduction improved computational efficiency and preserved predictive performance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify the network complexity,
      information flow, and effect of critical-node failures on a prototypical regional
      anesthesia and perioperative pain medicine (RAPPM) service using social network
      analysis. DESIGN: Pilot cross-sectional investigation. SETTING: This study was
      conducted at a prototypical single-center, multi-location academic anesthesiology
      department with an active RAPPM service. INTERVENTIONS: We constructed an
      empirically derived prototypical social network representative of a large
      academic RAPPM service. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary objective was measurement
      of network complexity via network size, structure, and information flow metrics. 
      The secondary objective identified, via network simulation, those nodes whose
      deletion via single, two-level, or three-level node failures would result in the 
      greatest network fragmentation. Exploratory analyses measured the impact of nodal
      failures on the resulting network complexity. RESULTS: The baseline network
      consisted of 84 nodes and 208 edges with a low density of 0.03 and high
      Krackhardt hierarchy of 0.787. Nodes exhibited low average total degree
      centrality (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) of 0.03 +/- 0.034 and mean
      eigenvector centrality of 0.164 +/- 0.182. The RAPPM resident-on-call was
      identified as the critical node in a single-node failure, with the resulting
      network fragmentation increasing from 0 to 0.52 upon node failure. A two-level
      failure involved both the RAPPM resident-on-call as well as the RAPPM
      attending-on-call, with the resulting fragmentation expanding to 0.772. A
      three-level node failure included the RAPPM resident-on-call, the main block-room
      attending, and block room fellow with fragmentation increasing to 0.814.
      CONCLUSIONS: The RAPPM service entails considerable network complexity and
      increased hierarchy, but low centrality. The network is at considerable
      fragmentation risk from even single-node failure.

TI  - Primary payer status is associated with the use of nerve block placement for
      ambulatory orthopedic surgery.
PG  - 254-61
LID - 10.1097/AAP.0b013e31824889b6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although more than 30 million patients in the United States undergo
      ambulatory surgery each year, it remains unclear what percentage of these
      patients receive a perioperative nerve block. We reviewed data from the 2006
      National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery to determine the demographic,
      socioeconomic, geographic, and clinical factors associated with the likelihood of
      nerve block placement for ambulatory orthopedic surgery. The primary outcome of
      interest was the association between primary method of payment and likelihood of 
      nerve block placement. In addition, we examined the association between type of
      surgical procedures, patient demographics, and hospital characteristics with the 
      likelihood of receiving a nerve block. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
      reviewed 6000 orthopedic anesthetics from the 2006 National Survey of Ambulatory 
      Surgery data set, which accounted for more than 3.9 million orthopedic
      anesthetics when weighted. The primary outcome of this study addressed the
      likelihood of receiving a nerve block for orthopedic ambulatory surgery according
      to the patient's primary method of payment. Secondary end points included
      differences in demographics, surgical procedures, adverse effects, complications,
      recovery profile, anesthesia staffing model, and total perioperative charges in
      those with and without nerve block. RESULTS: Overall, 14.9% of anesthetics in
      this sample involved a peripheral nerve block. Length of time in postoperative
      recovery, total perioperative time, and total charges were less for those
      receiving nerve blocks. Patients were more likely to receive a nerve block if
      their procedures were performed in metropolitan service areas (odds ratio [OR],
      1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.91; P = 0.007) or in freestanding
      surgical facilities (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.74-2.96; P < 0.0001) and if payment for 
      their surgery was supported by government programs (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.01-6.21; P
      = 0.048) or private insurance (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.12-6.13; P = 0.03) versus
      self-pay or charity care. CONCLUSIONS: For patients receiving ambulatory
      orthopedic surgery in the United States, our results suggest that geographic and 
      socioeconomic factors are associated with different likelihoods of perioperative 
      peripheral nerve block placement.

TI  - Use of machine learning theory to predict the need for femoral nerve block
      following ACL repair.
PG  - 1566-75
LID - 10.1111/j.1526-4637.2011.01228.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report on a classification approach using machine learning (ML)
      algorithms for prediction of postoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) requirement 
      following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. BACKGROUND: FNBs are
      commonly performed for ACL reconstruction to control postoperative pain. Ideally,
      anesthesiologists would target preoperative FNB only to ACL reconstruction
      patients expected to experience severe postoperative pain. Perioperative factors 
      associated with postoperative FNB placement following ACL reconstruction remain
      unclear, may differ among separate surgical facilities, and render such
      predictions difficult. METHODS: We conducted a chart review of 349 patients who
      underwent ACL reconstruction at a single outpatient surgical facility. Standard
      perioperative data commonly available during routine preoperative examination
      were recorded. ML classifiers based on logistic regression, BayesNet, multilayer 
      perceptron, support vector machine, and alternating decision tree (ADTree)
      algorithms were then developed to predict which patients would require
      postoperative FNB. RESULTS: Each of the ML algorithms outperformed traditional
      logistic regression using a very limited data set as measured by the area under
      the receiver operating curve, with ADTree achieving the highest score of 0.7 in
      the cross-validated sample. Logistic regression outperformed all other
      classifiers with regard to kappa statistics and percent correctly classified. All
      models were prone to overfitting in comparisons of training vs cross-validated
      samples. CONCLUSION: ML classifiers may offer improved predictive capabilities
      when analyzing medical data sets compared with traditional statistical
      methodologies in predicting severe postoperative pain requiring peripheral nerve 
      block.

TI  - Role of interleukin-6 in a patient with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
      periodic syndrome: assessment of outcomes following treatment with the
      anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab.
PG  - 1151-5
LID - 10.1002/art.30215 [doi]
AB  - In this report, we describe treatment outcomes in the first case of a patient
      with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) treated 
      with the anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab.
      Since IL-6 levels are elevated in TRAPS, we hypothesized that tocilizumab might
      be effective. The patient, a 52-year-old man with lifelong TRAPS in whom
      treatment with etanercept and anakinra had failed, was administered tocilizumab
      for 6 months, and the therapeutic response was assessed by measurement of
      monocyte CD16 expression and cytokine levels. Following treatment, the evolving
      acute attack was aborted and further attacks of TRAPS were prevented. The patient
      did not require corticosteroids and showed significant clinical improvement in
      scores for pain, stiffness, and well-being. Moreover, the acute-phase response
      diminished significantly with treatment. Monocyte CD16 expression was reduced and
      the numbers of circulating CD14+CD16+ and CD14++CD16- monocytes were transiently 
      decreased. However, cytokine levels were not reduced. This case supports the
      notion of a prominent role for IL-6 in mediating the inflammatory attacks in
      TRAPS, but blockade of IL-6 did not affect the underlying pathogenesis. These
      preliminary findings require confirmation.

      complications.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.4103/0973-6042.68410 [doi]
AB  - Surgeons and patients are often reluctant to support regional anesthesia (RA) for
      shoulder and other orthopedic surgeries. This is because of the sometimes true
      but usually incorrectly perceived "slowing down" of operating room turnover time 
      and the perceived potential for added morbidity. Recently, severe devastating and
      permanent nerve injury complications have surfaced, and this article attempts to 
      clarify the modern place of RA for shoulder surgery and the prevention of these
      complications. A philosophical approach to anesthesiology and regional
      anesthesiology is offered, while a fresh appreciation for the well-described and 
      often forgotten microanatomy of the brachial plexus is revisited to explain and
      avoid some of the devastating complications of RA for shoulder surgery.
