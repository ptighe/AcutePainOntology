We have previously shown that different C-type lectin receptors on DCs play a major role in allergen recognition and uptake. In particular, mannose receptor (MR), through modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling, can regulate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity, favoring TH2 responses. Interestingly, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor with an emerging role in immune modulation, has been implicated in IDO activation in response to TLR stimulation.","Here we investigated how allergens and lectins modulate the TLR4-AhR-IDO axis in human monocyte-derived DCs.","Using a combination of genomics, proteomics, and immunologic studies, we investigated the role of MR and AhR in IDO regulation and its effect on T helper cell differentiation.","We have demonstrated that LPS induces both IDO isoforms (IDO1 and IDO2) in DCs, with partial involvement of AhR. Additionally, we found that, like mannan, different airborne allergens can effectively downregulate TLR4-induced IDO1 and IDO2 expression, most likely through binding to the MR. Mannose-based ligands were also able to downregulate IL-12p70 production by DCs, affecting T helper cell polarization. Interestingly, AhR and some components of the noncanonical nuclear factor κB pathway were shown to be downregulated after MR engagement, which could explain the regulatory effects of MR on IDO expression.","Our work demonstrates a key role for MR in the modulation of the TLR4-AhR-IDO axis, which has a significant effect on DC behavior and the development of immune responses against allergens.","Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

However, little is known about the time required until patients consistently report minimal postoperative pain.","We conducted a retrospective cohort study of surgical case data from 7293 adult patients to examine the impact of age, gender, and the type of surgery on the time to sustained postoperative pain relief (SuPPR). We defined SuPPR as the time required until a patient reports the first of multiple (2, 3, 4, or 5 sequential measurements; e.g., SuPPR-2, SuPPR-3, etc.), uninterrupted, mild pain scores (≤4/10).","Overall, SuPPR times ranged from 3 minutes for SuPPR-2 and 9 minutes for SuPPR-5 to 160.1 hour for SuPPR-2 and 183.1 hour for SuPPR-5. For the SuPPR-2 outcome, the median time to event was 10.9 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 3-26.1 h) after surgery. For the SuPPR-5 outcomes, the median time to event was 31.5 hours (IQR, 17.8-54.2 h) after surgery. The peak median difference between two sequential SuPPR definitions was between SuPPR-3 and SuPPR-2 at 9 hours, with subsequent decreases to 6.5 hours between SuPPR-4 and SuPPR-3, and 5.2 hours between SuPPR-5 and SuPPR-4.

It is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in TNF receptor superfamily 1A gene localised to exons encoding the ectodomain of the p55 TNF receptor, TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of cell surface TNFR1 in TRAPS, and the contribution of TNF-dependent and TNF-independent mechanisms to the production of cytokines. HEK-293 and SK-HEP-1 cell lines were stably transfected with WT or TRAPS-associated variants of human TNF receptor superfamily 1A gene. An anti-TNFR1 single domain antibody (dAb), and an anti-TNFR1 mAb, bound to cell surface WT and variant TNFR1s. In HEK-293 cells transfected with death domain-inactivated (R347A) TNFR1, and in SK-HEP-1 cells transfected with normal (full-length) TNFR1, cytokine production stimulated in the absence of exogenous TNF by the presence of certain TNFR1 variants was not inhibited by the anti-TNFR1 dAb. In SK-Hep-1 cells, specific TRAPS mutations increased the level of cytokine response to TNF, compared to WT, and this augmented cytokine production was suppressed by the anti-TNFR1 dAb. Thus, TRAPS-associated variants of TNFR1 enhance cytokine production by a TNF-independent mechanism and by sensitising cells to a TNF-dependent stimulation. The TNF-dependent mechanism requires cell surface expression of TNFR1, as this is blocked by TNFR1-specific dAb.","© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Temporally, the proportion of tweets with positive sentiment ranged from 24% at 1600 to 38% at 2400, with a median of 32%. The Twitter-based social networks pertaining to pain exhibited greater sparsity and lower connectedness than did those social networks pertaining to common terms such as apple, Manchester United, and Obama. The number of word clusters in proportion to node count was greater for emotion terms such as tired (0.45), happy (0.43), and sad (0.4) when compared with objective terms such as apple (0.26), Manchester United (0.14), and Obama (0.25).","Taken together, our results suggest that pain-related tweets carry special characteristics reflecting unique content and their communication among tweeters. Further work will explore how geopolitical events and seasonal changes affect tweeters' perceptions of pain and how such perceptions may affect therapies for pain.","","Tighe","Patrick J","PJ","http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1881-9941","University of Florida College of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Gainesville, FL, United States. ptighe@anest.ufl.edu.","","","Goldsmith","Ryan C","RC","http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8162-2159","","Gravenstein","Michael","M","http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6400-4789","","Bernard","H Russell","HR","http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1367-2813","","Fillingim","Roger B","RB","http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7699-8183","","","eng","K23 GM 102697","GM","NIGMS NIH HHS","United States","","K23 GM102697","GM","NIGMS NIH HHS","United States","","UL1 TR001427","TR","NCATS NIH HHS","United States","","","Journal Article","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","","2015","04","02","","","Canada","J Med Internet Res","100959882","1438-8871","","IM","BMJ Qual Saf. 2013 Mar;22(3):194-202","23178860","","Br J Sports Med. 2012 Mar;46(4):258-63","21406451","","J Peripher Nerv Syst. 2013 Mar;18(1):37-43","23521642","","PLoS One. 2013;8(5):e64417","23734200","","PLoS One. 2014;9(1):e84265","24416209","","Tob Control. 2012 Jul;21(4):447-9","21730101","","Chaos. 2012 Jun;22(2):023138","22757545","","Telemed J E Health. 2012 Jul-Aug;18(6):404-8","22650380","","BMJ. 2012;345:e4814","22826588","","Cephalalgia. 2013 Jan;33(1):68-9","23136208","","Pain. 2014 May;155(5):1016-26","24525273","","Int J Palliat Nurs. 2013 Jan;19(1):6-7","23354427","","Anesth Analg. 2003 Aug;97(2):534-40, table of contents","12873949","","Pain. 1995 May;61(2):309-15","7659442","","JAMA. 1995 Nov 22-29;274(20):1591-8","7474243","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 May 13;94(10):5489-94","9144265","","J Epidemiol Community Health. 2004 Dec;58(12):971-5","15547054","","Psychol Sci. 2005 Sep;16(9):724-31","16137259","","Chronic Illn. 2005 Jun;1(2):121-9","17136918","","Br J Anaesth. 2008 Jul;101(1):111-20","18487247","","Science. 2009 Feb 13;323(5916):892-5","19213908","","Pain Med. 2009 Sep;10(6):1018-34","19594848","","Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys. 2009 Nov;80(5 Pt 2):056117","20365053","","Psychosomatics. 2010 Jul-Aug;51(4):338-338.e8","20587762","","PLoS One. 2010;5(11):e14118","21124761","","Scand J Psychol. 2011 Apr;52(2):146-53","21054422","","Pediatrics. 2011 Apr;127(4):800-4","21444588","","PLoS One. 2011;6(5):e19467","21573238","","J Dent Res. 2011 Sep;90(9):1047-51","21768306","","Urology. 2011 Oct;78(4):764-7","21862115","","Disabil Rehabil. 2011;33(23-24):2372-80","21504406","","Pain. 2011 Dec;152(12):2773-80","21963240","","PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e26752","22163266","","Fertil Steril. 2012 Jan;97(1):88-94","22088209","","Epilepsy Behav. 2012 Feb;23(2):127-30","22134096","","BMJ Qual Saf. 2013 Mar;22(3):251-5","23349387","","","Humans","","Internet","","Pain","","Philippines","","Social Media","","Social Networking","","","PMC4400316","Twitter messaging","emotions","social networks","text mining","","","2014","8","22","","2015","1","21","","2014","12","17","","2015","4","7","6","0","","2015","4","7","6","0","","2015","11","13","6","0","","","epublish","v17i4e84","10.2196/jmir.3769","25843553","PMC4400316","",""

Various immune cells express SP and its neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) isoforms. A role for SP has been demonstrated in a number of autoimmune conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS). In this work, we studied the role of SP and NK1R in human immune cells with a focus on their relationship with IL-12/IL-23 family cytokines and the associated IFN-γ/IL-17.","(1) To determine the role of SP mediated effects on induction of various inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC); (2) to investigate the expression of SP and its receptor in T cells and the effects of stimulation with IL-12 and IL-23. Quantitative real-time PCR, flow cytometry, ELISA, promoter studies on PBMC and primary T cells from healthy volunteers, and Jurkat cell line. Treatment with SP significantly increased the expression of IL-12/IL-23 subunit p40, IL-23 p19 and IL-12 p35 mRNA in human PBMC. Expression of NK1R and SP in T cells was upregulated by IL-23 but a trend was observed with IL-12. The IL-23 effect likely involves IL-17 production that additionally mediates IL-23 effects. Mutual interactions exist with SP enhancing the cytokines IL-23 and IL-12, and SP and NK1R expression being differentially but potentially synergistically regulated by these cytokines. These findings suggest a proinflammatory role for SP in autoimmune inflammation. We propose a model whereby immunocyte derived SP stimulates Th1 and Th17 autoreactive cells migrating to the central nervous system (CNS), enhances their crossing the blood brain barrier and perpetuates inflammation in the CNS by being released from damaged nerves and activating both resident glia and infiltrating immune cells. SP may be a therapeutic target in MS.","","Vilisaar","Janek","J","Division of Clinical Neurology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.","","","Kawabe","Kiyokazu","K","","Braitch","Manjit","M","","Aram","Jehan","J","","Furtun","Yasemin","Y","","Fahey","Angela J","AJ","","Chopra","Mark","M","","Tanasescu","Radu","R","","Tighe","Patrick J","PJ","","Gran","Bruno","B","","Pothoulakis","Charalabos","C","","Constantinescu","Cris S","CS","","","eng","R01 DK047343","DK","NIDDK NIH HHS","United States","","","Journal Article","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","","2015","02","18","","","United States","J Neuroimmune Pharmacol","101256586","1557-1890","","IM","J Neurochem. 2005 Oct;95(2):331-40","16086689","","Nat Immunol. 2005 Jun;6(6):558-64","15908937","","J Neuroimmunol. 2006 Oct;179(1-2):1-8","16904192","","J Neuroimmunol. 2006 Nov;180(1-2):117-25","16942803","","J Immunol. 2007 Feb 15;178(4):2589-98","17277169","","J Immunol. 2007 Sep 1;179(5):3342-50","17709551","","J Biol Chem. 2007 Oct 12;282(41):30039-50","17709376","","Brain Behav Immun. 2008 May;22(4):442-50","18061399","","Infect Immun. 2008 Aug;76(8):3651-6","18505813","","J Leukoc Biol. 2009 Jan;85(1):154-64","18835883","","Cytokine. 2010 Apr;50(1):19-23","20045653","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Mar 2;107(9):4293-8","20160079","","Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2011 Jan;1217:83-95","21091716","","Trends Mol Med. 2011 Mar;17(3):119-25","21251877","","J Immunol. 2011 Apr 1;186(7):4175-82","21368235","","Br J Pharmacol. 2011 Oct;164(4):1079-106","21371012","","J Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2012 Mar;7(1):253-65","22012268","","Nat Rev Neurol. 2012 Nov 5;8(11):647-56","23007702","","Blood. 2013 Apr 11;121(15):2923-33","23365459","","J Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2013 Sep;8(4):791-806","23812895","","Biomed J. 2014 Mar-Apr;37(2):34-40","24732657","","Acta Physiol (Oxf). 2015 Feb;213(2):453-61","25424746","","J Immunol. 2000 Jan 15;164(2):839-47","10623830","","Gut. 2000 Sep;47(3):387-96","10940277","","FASEB J. 2001 Apr;15(6):950-7","11292655","","J Neuroimmunol. 2002 Apr;125(1-2):141-8","11960650","","J Immunol. 2002 Jun 1;168(11):5699-708","12023369","","Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2003 Feb;284(2):G197-204","12388184","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Mar 4;100(5):2957-62","12594338","","J Immunol. 2003 May 15;170(10):5003-7","12734344","","Immunology. 2003 Jul;109(3):415-25","12807488","","Neuropeptides. 2003 Dec;37(6):355-61","14698678","","Eur J Pharmacol. 2004 Jun 28;494(2-3):233-9","15212980","","J Cell Physiol. 2004 Nov;201(2):167-80","15334652","","Peptides. 1985;6 Suppl 2:107-11","2417206","","Science. 1987 Feb 20;235(4791):893-5","2433770","","Immunology. 1988 Apr;63(4):733-5","2452790","","J Invest Dermatol. 1990 Apr;94(4):492-5","1690249","","Brain Res. 1989 Dec 18;504(2):284-8","2480834","","Science. 1988 Sep 2;241(4870):1218-21","2457950","","Scand J Immunol. 1990 Apr;31(4):529-33","1692157","","Eur J Biochem. 1992 Mar 15;204(3):1025-33","1312928","","J Immunol. 1992 Jun 1;148(11):3498-504","1375246","","J Immunol. 1993 Jun 15;150(12):5281-8","8515059","","J Immunol. 1993 Jul 1;151(1):225-33","7686934","","J Neuroimmunol. 1996 Dec;71(1-2):73-80","8982105","","J Neuroimmunol. 1996 Dec;71(1-2):163-71","8982116","","J Immunol. 1997 Mar 1;158(5):2334-9","9036982","","J Immunol. 1997 Apr 15;158(8):3895-901","9103459","","Br J Pharmacol. 1998 Jul;124(6):1013-5","9720767","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Oct 13;95(21):12544-9","9770522","","J Immunol. 2005 Apr 1;174(7):3906-11","15778345","","Genes Immun. 2005 May;6(3):265-70","15729363","","Nature. 2006 May 11;441(7090):235-8","16648838","","","PMC4543419","","2014","1","27","","2015","1","19","","2015","2","18","","2015","2","19","6","0","","2015","2","19","6","0","","2015","2","19","6","0","","","ppublish","10.1007/s11481-015-9589-x","25690155","PMC4543419","",""

Misfolding, intracellular aggregation, and ligand-independent signaling by mutant TNFR1 are central to disease pathophysiology. Our aim was to understand the extent of signaling pathway perturbation in TRAPS. A prototypic mutant TNFR1 (C33Y), and wild-type TNFR1 (WT), were expressed at near physiological levels in an SK-Hep-1 cell model. TNFR1-associated signaling pathway intermediates were examined in this model, and in PBMCs from C33Y TRAPS patients and healthy controls. In C33Y-TNFR1-expressing SK-Hep-1 cells and TRAPS patients' PBMCs, a subtle, constitutive upregulation of a wide spectrum of signaling intermediates and their phosphorylated forms was observed; these were associated with a proinflammatory/antiapoptotic phenotype. In TRAPS patients' PBMCs, this upregulation of proinflammatory signaling pathways was observed irrespective of concurrent treatment with glucocorticoids, anakinra or etanercept, and the absence of overt clinical symptoms at the time that the blood samples were taken. This study reveals the pleiotropic effect of a TRAPS-associated mutant form of TNFR1 on inflammatory signaling pathways (a proinflammatory signalome), which is consistent with the variable and limited efficacy of cytokine-blocking therapies in TRAPS. It highlights new potential target pathways for therapeutic intervention.","© 2014 The Authors. European Journal of Immunology published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Current ultrasound (US) examination methodologies may exclude visualization of these areas that may limit the sensitivity of the examination. This retrospective study uses computed tomography (CT) scans to precisely evaluate where free air within the thorax occurs and correlates this location with a presumably optimal US interrogation window.","A total of 94 CT scans of patients with a pneumothorax in a single institution from December 2006 to January 2010 were examined. The borders and volumes of each pneumothorax were precisely measured by a radiologist. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between volume and location of intrapleural air at specified areas of the hemithorax. Sensitivities relating location of intrapleural air at a specific landmark and side of thorax were calculated.","All but 3 of the pneumothoraces extended to the sternum. In all, 83 patients demonstrated a pneumothorax between rib interspaces 3 and 6 (mean pneumothorax volume 300.4 mL, 95% confidence interval [CI] 217.4-383.3), and 11 patients did not (mean pneumothorax volume 4.5 mL, 95% CI 1.7-7.3; P < .0001). The cumulative sensitivity for the presence of intrapleural air at rib interspaces 3 to 6 along the sternal border was 88%. This was consistent regardless of the side of hemithorax (right 91% and left 86%).","The CT scans demonstrate that intrapleural air most often collects along the mediastinum between ribs 3 and 6 on either side of the chest. Although no USs were performed in this retrospective study, one may infer that a parasternal approach along rib interspaces 3 to 6 is an easy and sensitive window to diagnose pneumothorax with US.","© The Author(s) 2013.","","Kiley","Sean","S","Department of Anesthesiology, University of Florida, College of Medicine, JHMHC, Gainesville, FL, USA skiley@anest.ufl.edu.","","","Tighe","Patrick","P","Department of Anesthesiology, University of Florida, College of Medicine, JHMHC, Gainesville, FL, USA.","","","Hajibrahim","Omar","O","Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Ireland Army Community Hospital, 277 Brentford Drive, Louisville, KY, USA.","","","Deitte","Lori","L","Department of Radiology, University of Florida, College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.","","","Gravenstein","Nikolaus","N","Department of Anesthesiology, University of Florida, College of Medicine, JHMHC, Gainesville, FL, USA.","","","Robinson","Albert","A","3rd","Department of Anesthesiology, University of Florida, College of Medicine, JHMHC, Gainesville, FL, USA.","","","","eng","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review","","2013","05","22","","","United States","J Intensive Care Med","8610344","0885-0666","","IM","Adult","","Aged","","Air","","Female","","Humans","","Logistic Models","","Male","","Middle Aged","","Pleural Cavity","pathology","radiography","","Pneumothorax","ultrasonography","","Radiography, Thoracic","","Reproducibility of Results","","Retrospective Studies","","Ribs","pathology","ultrasonography","","Sensitivity and Specificity","","Supine Position","","Tomography, X-Ray Computed","","","chest CT scan","landmarks","pneumothorax","ultrasound","","","2013","5","22","","2013","6","12","6","0","","2013","6","12","6","0","","2015","7","24","6","0","","","ppublish","23753251","0885066613488735","10.1177/0885066613488735","",""

Of 203 participants screened, 101 patients with ischemic heart disease and 71 healthy volunteers completed the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or folic acid at doses of 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 mg/d for 26 wk; subsamples of patients with ischemic heart disease were also examined at 6 or 12 wk.","Participants with higher baseline homocysteine concentrations had the greatest reductions in homocysteine in response to folic acid doses of 0.2 mg (-20.6%), 0.4 mg (-20.7%), and 0.8 mg (-27.8%); in those with lower baseline homocysteine concentrations, the responses were -8.2%, -8.9%, and -8.3%, respectively. No significant differences in homocysteine responses to the different doses were observed. In the patient group sampled at intervals during the intervention, the maximal homocysteine response appeared to be achieved by 6 wk in the 0.8-mg/d group and by 12 wk in the 0.4-mg/d group. However, the homocysteine response was suboptimal in the 0.2-mg/d group at both 6 and 12 wk compared with that at 26 wk.","A folic acid dose as low as 0.2 mg/d can, if administered for 6 mo, effectively lower homocysteine concentrations. Higher doses may not be necessary because they result in no further significant lowering, whereas doses even lower than 0.2 mg/d may be effective in the longer term.

Methods","","Multiple protein extract microarray for profiling human food-specific immunoglobulins A, M, G and E.","21-32","","10.1016/j.jim.2010.10.004","Existing food immunoglobulin (Ig) tests require large volumes of serum, are limited to one immunoglobulin class, are not amenable to high throughput analysis and only give a limited picture of the immunological response to food antigens. Conversely a new generation of Component Resolved Diagnostic systems using pure proteins is highly specific and totally dependent on the availability of the protein in its recombinant or natural origin form. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a microarray test based on protein extracts of food components. Our approach relies on innovations on three different fronts: the novelty of using arrayed food samples sequentially extracted with detergent and chaotropic agents, the ability to measure four different Ig classes simultaneously and the ability to analyse the generated data via a suitable bioinformatics/statistical analysis interface. This approach combines high numerical power of microarrays with automation, high throughput analysis and enables detailed investigation of the Ig profiles to food antigens. The prototype shown contains extracts of approximately 350 food ingredients that cover most of the food products found in the UK. Here we showed that the use of a sequential extraction technique to solubilise and then denature food samples has its benefits in the assessment of variations in antigenicity when tested with human sera. A patient dependent degree of class specificity was observed with human sera (IgG specificity correlates well with IgA>IgM>IgE). Besides generating a simultaneous profile for IgA, IgM, IgG and IgE the array system has shown good discrimination between challenge responders in atopic and non-atopic individuals. Poly- and mono-specific IgE responders were easily identified. The mathematical modelling of specific IgE content showed good correlations when compared with established IgE antibody testing assay (UniCAP). Although in its proof-of-principle stages, the immune profiling technique described here has the potential to provide unique insights into exposure/sensitization and establish relationships between specific immunoglobulin classes and subclasses against food protein antigens. In further developments, the immune profiling technique could also be extended to other related areas such as parasite and bacterial gut infection. Full analyses of large longitudinal and retrospective clinical trials are on going to determine the positive and negative predictive values of the technique.","Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We show that MR mediates internalization of diverse allergens from mite (Der p 1 and Der p 2), dog (Can f 1), cockroach (Bla g 2), and peanut (Ara h 1) through their carbohydrate moieties. All of these allergens bind to the C-type lectin-like carbohydrate recognition domains 4-7 of MR. We have also assessed the contribution of MR to T cell polarization after allergen exposure. We show that silencing MR expression on monocyte-derived DCs reverses the Th2 cell polarization bias, driven by Der p 1 allergen exposure, through upregulation of IDO activity.

The effects of preservation and processing on amnion proteome were investigated, and the major proteins in the TRAM characterized using mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. This identified a spectrum of proteins including thrombospondin, mimecan, BIG-H3, and integrin alpha 6. Preservation compromises cellular viability resulting in selective elution of soluble cellular proteins, leaving behind extracellular matrix-associated and cell structural proteins. A number of key architectural proteins common to the architecture of the ocular surface were demonstrated in AM, which are involved in homeostasis and wound healing. Handling procedures alter the protein composition of amniotic membrane prepared for transplantation. Without standardization, there will be inter-membrane variation, which may compromise the desired therapeutic effect of transplant ready amniotic membrane.","","Hopkinson","Andrew","A","Division of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom.","","","McIntosh","Richard S","RS","","Shanmuganathan","Vijay","V","","Tighe","Patrick J","PJ","","Dua","Harminder S","HS","","","eng","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","","","United States","J Proteome Res","101128775","1535-3893","","0","Proteins","","","IM","J Proteome Res. 2006 Sep;5(9):2074","16969946","","","Amnion","chemistry","transplantation","","Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional","","Eye Injuries","therapy","","Humans","","Immunoblotting","","Mass Spectrometry","","Proteins","analysis","","Proteomics","methods","","Specimen Handling","methods","","","","2006","9","2","9","0","","2006","12","9","9","0","","2006","9","2","9","0","","","ppublish","10.1021/pr050425q","16944934","",""

Recently, the related heterodimeric cytokine, IL-23, composed of the same p40 subunit as IL-12 and a unique p19 subunit, was shown to be involved in Th1 responses and EAE. We investigated whether astrocytes and microglia, CNS cells with antigen-presenting cell (APC) function can present antigen to myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive T cells, and whether this presentation is blocked with antibodies against IL-12/IL-23p40. Interferon (IFN)-gamma-treated APC induced proliferation of MBP-reactive T cells. Anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibodies blocked this proliferation. These results support and extend our previous observation that astrocytes and microglia produce IL-12/IL-23p40. Moreover, we show that stimulated astrocytes and microglia produce biologically active IL-12p70. Because IL-12 and IL-23 share p40, we wanted to determine whether astrocytes also express IL-12p35 and IL-23p19, as microglia were already shown to express them. Astrocytes expressed IL-12p35 mRNA constitutively, and IL-23 p19 after stimulation. Thus, astrocytes, under inflammatory conditions, express all subunits of IL-12/IL-23. Their ability to present antigen to encephalitogenic T cells can be blocked by neutralizing anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibodies.","","Constantinescu","Cris S","CS","Division of Clinical Neurology, University Hospital, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK. cris.constantinescu@nottingham.ac.uk","","","Tani","Marie","M","","Ransohoff","Richard M","RM","","Wysocka","Maria","M","","Hilliard","Brendan","B","","Fujioka","Toshiki","T","","Murphy","Sean","S","","Tighe","Patrick J","PJ","","Das Sarma","Jayasri","J","","Trinchieri","Giorgio","G","","Rostami","Abdolmohamad","A","","","eng","K11 HD-01049","HD","NICHD NIH HHS","United States","","NS 29226","NS","NINDS NIH HHS","United States","","NS32151","NS","NINDS NIH HHS","United States","","","Journal Article","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","","2005","08","08","","","England","J Neurochem","2985190R","0022-3042","","0","Il23a protein, mouse","","0","Interleukin-23","","0","Interleukin-23 Subunit p19","","0","Interleukins","","0","Myelin Basic Protein","","187348-17-0","Interleukin-12","","","IM","Animals","","Animals, Newborn","physiology","","Antigen-Presenting Cells","physiology","","Astrocytes","immunology","metabolism","","Cell Proliferation","","Cell Separation","","Cells, Cultured","","Interleukin-12","biosynthesis","immunology","","Interleukin-23","","Interleukin-23 Subunit p19","","Interleukins","biosynthesis","immunology","","Mice","","Myelin Basic Protein","metabolism","","Neuroglia","immunology","physiology","","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","","T-Lymphocytes","immunology","physiology","","","","2005","8","8","","2005","8","10","9","0","","2005","11","3","9","0","","2005","8","10","9","0","","","ppublish","JNC3368","10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03368.x","16086689","",""

IA-2 responsive T cells recognize determinants within regions represented by amino acids 787-817 and 841-869 of the molecule. Epitopes for IA-2 autoantibodies are largely conformational and not well defined. In this study, we used peptide phage display and homology modeling to characterize the epitope of a monoclonal IA-2 Ab (96/3) from a human type 1 diabetic patient. This Ab competes for IA-2 binding with Abs from the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes and therefore binds a region close to common autoantibody epitopes. Alignment of peptides obtained after screening phage-displayed peptide libraries with purified 96/3 identified a consensus binding sequence of Asn-x-Glu-x-x-(aromatic)-x-x-Gly. The predicted surface on a three-dimensional homology model of the tyrosine phosphatase domain of IA-2 was analyzed for clusters of Asn, Glu, and aromatic residues and amino acids contributing to the epitope investigated using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of each of amino acids Asn(858), Glu(836), and Trp(799) reduced 96/3 Ab binding by >45%. Mutations of these residues also inhibited binding of serum autoantibodies from IA-2 Ab-positive type 1 diabetic patients. This study identifies a region commonly recognized by autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes that overlaps with dominant T cell determinants.","","Dromey","James A","JA","Department of Medicine, Guy's, King's, and St. Thomas' School of Medicine, King's College, London, United Kingdom.","","","Weenink","Sarah M","SM","","Peters","Günther H","GH","","Endl","Josef","J","","Tighe","Patrick J","PJ","","Todd","Ian","I","","Christie","Michael R","MR","","","eng","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","","","United States","J Immunol","2985117R","0022-1767","","0","Antibodies, Monoclonal","","0","Autoantibodies","","0","Autoantigens","","0","Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte","","0","ICA512 autoantibody","","0","Peptide Library","","","AIM","IM","Amino Acid Sequence","","Amino Acid Substitution","genetics","immunology","","Antibodies, Monoclonal","chemistry","","Autoantibodies","blood","chemistry","","Autoantigens","chemistry","genetics","immunology","","Bacteriophage M13","","Binding Sites, Antibody","genetics","","Clone Cells","","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1","immunology","","Epitope Mapping","methods","","Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte","chemistry","","Humans","","Models, Molecular","","Molecular Sequence Data","","Mutagenesis, Site-Directed","","Peptide Library","","Protein Conformation","","","","2004","3","23","5","0","","2004","7","31","5","0","","2004","3","23","5","0","","","ppublish","15034020","",""

Methods","","An immuno-precipitation assay for determining specific interactions between antibodies and phage selected from random peptide expression libraries.","163-71","","Libraries of random peptides displayed by bacteriophage can be screened to select phage expressing peptides that specifically bind antibodies, so that the peptide sequence motifs expressed by the phage can help to define the epitopes of the antibodies. It is often desirable to screen antibody-selected phage for binding of the selecting antibody in an immunoassay in order to verify the specificity of the interaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, for many antibodies, the best techniques for measuring specific, high affinity interactions are immuno-precipitation assays. Immuno-precipitation was therefore investigated as a means of measuring interactions between antibodies and phage clones selected from random peptide display libraries. Three mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for glutamic acid decarboxylase were used to select peptides as 9-mers on T7 phage, linear 12-mers on pIII of M13 phage, or constrained 15-mers on pVIII of M13 phage. Following the cloning and sequencing of selected phage, mixtures of antibody and phage were incubated in solution and the immune complexes were precipitated with Protein G bound to Sepharose beads. In order to detect and quantitate the phage that had formed immune complexes and been precipitated, advantage was taken of the biological properties of the phage by inducing infection of Escherichia coli by the precipitated phage. The aim was to quantitate the phage precipitated by determining the number of plaques produced, which would therefore be proportional to the degree of interaction between the phage and the antibody in solution. The results presented here indicate that this method of measuring monoclonal antibody interactions with phage selected for expression of peptides recognised by the monoclonal antibody is highly specific and sensitive.","","Al-bukhari","T A M A","TA","Division of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, School of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Nottingham, A Floor West Block, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK.","","","Tighe","P","P","","Todd","I","I","","","eng","Journal Article","","","Netherlands","J Immunol Methods","1305440","0022-1759","","0","Antibodies, Monoclonal","","0","Isoenzymes","","0","Peptide Fragments","","0","Peptide Library","","EC 4.1.1.15","Glutamate Decarboxylase","","EC 4.1.1.15","glutamate decarboxylase 2","","","IM","Amino Acid Sequence","","Animals","","Antibodies, Monoclonal","metabolism","","Antibody Specificity","","Bacteriophage M13","genetics","immunology","metabolism","","Bacteriophage T7","genetics","immunology","metabolism","","Binding Sites, Antibody","","Clone Cells","","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","","Glutamate Decarboxylase","immunology","metabolism","","Isoenzymes","immunology","metabolism","","Mice","","Molecular Sequence Data","","Peptide Fragments","biosynthesis","genetics","isolation & purification","","Peptide Library","","Precipitin Tests","methods","","Sequence Analysis, Protein","","Viral Plaque Assay","","","","2002","8","23","10","0","","2002","9","11","10","1","","2002","8","23","10","0","","","ppublish","12191519","S0022175902000807","",""

We investigated the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta isoforms by isolated and cultured primary human intestinal myofibroblasts and the responsiveness of these cells and intestinal epithelial cells to TGF-beta isoforms. Normal intestinal myofibroblasts released predominantly TGF-beta(3) and ulcerative colitis myofibroblasts expressed both TGF-beta(1) and TGF-beta(3), whereas in myofibroblast cultures from fibrotic Crohn's disease tissue, there was significantly lower expression of TGF-beta(3) but enhanced release of TGF-beta(2). These distinctive patterns of TGF-beta isoform release were sustained through several myofibroblast passages. Proliferation of Crohn's disease myofibroblasts was significantly greater than that of myofibroblasts derived from normal and ulcerative colitis tissue. In contrast to cells from normal and ulcerative colitis tissue, neutralization of the three TGF-beta isoforms did not affect the proliferation of Crohn's disease intestinal myofibroblasts. Studies on the effect of recombinant TGF-beta isoforms on epithelial restitution and proliferation suggest that TGF-beta(2) may be the least effective of the three isoforms in intestinal wound repair. In conclusion, the enhanced release of TGF-beta(2) but reduced expression of TGF-beta(3) by Crohn's disease intestinal myofibroblasts, together with their enhanced proliferative capacity, may lead to the development of intestinal strictures.","","McKaig","B C","BC","Division of Gastroenterology, University Hospital, Nottingham NG7 2UH, United Kingdom.","","","Hughes","K","K","","Tighe","P J","PJ","","Mahida","Y R","YR","","","eng","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","","","United States","Am J Physiol Cell Physiol","100901225","0363-6143","","0","Actins","","0","Desmin","","0","RNA, Messenger","","0","Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta","","0","TGFB2 protein, human","","0","Transforming Growth Factor beta","","0","Transforming Growth Factor beta2","","0","Transforming Growth Factor beta3","","0","Vimentin","","EC 2.7.1.11","TGF-beta type I receptor","","EC 2.7.11.1","Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","","EC 2.7.11.30","Activin Receptors, Type I","","EC 2.7.11.30","transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor","","","IM","Actins","analysis","","Activin Receptors, Type I","genetics","","Cell Division","physiology","","Cells, Cultured","","Colitis, Ulcerative","pathology","physiopathology","","Colon","cytology","","Crohn Disease","pathology","physiopathology","","Desmin","analysis","","Fibroblasts","chemistry","physiology","ultrastructure","","Fibrosis","","Gene Expression","physiology","","Humans","","Intestinal Mucosa","chemistry","cytology","physiology","","Isomerism","","Microscopy, Electron","","Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","","RNA, Messenger","analysis","","Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta","genetics","","Transforming Growth Factor beta","chemistry","genetics","","Transforming Growth Factor beta2","","Transforming Growth Factor beta3","","Vimentin","analysis","","Wound Healing","physiology","","","","2001","12","18","10","0","","2002","1","16","10","1","","2001","12","18","10","0","","","ppublish","11742810","10.1152/ajpcell.00048.2001","",""

Homozygous ms1 mutants do not produce viable pollen, but are otherwise phenotypically normal. Degeneration of pollen occurs soon after microspore release from the tetrads, at which time the tapetum also appears abnormally vacuolated. The MS1 gene is expressed at low levels in anthers from closed buds, with expression in the tapetum at the stage of microspore release. No expression is seen in open flowers. The deduced MS1 protein sequence shows strong homology to the PHD-finger motif found in known transcription factors from humans, yeast and higher plants. Six alleles of ms1 have been identified; all result in premature termination of the MS1 protein and loss of the PHD-finger motif. MS1 is likely to play a key role in regulating transcription during specific stages of male gametogenesis and anther development. As such, MS1 provides a valuable tool for the manipulation of male sterility in higher plants.","","Wilson","Z A","ZA","Plant Science Division, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, Leics., UK.

Inappropriate cytokine synthesis may direct the local immune response away from a type-1 (cellular) pattern and may subsequently contribute to the development and progression of precancer. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a competitive mimic was carried out to determine type-1 (interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)) and type-2 (interleukin-10 (IL-10)) cytokine mRNA levels in whole cervical specimens (without microdissection) from seven normal and nine HPV-16 positive CIN formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Microdissection was used to measure separately the epithelial and sub-epithelial levels of IFN-gamma and IL-10 mRNAs in 11 specimens of normal cervix and 25 HPV-16 positive CIN (nine CIN 1, seven CIN 2 and nine CIN 3). IFN-gamma mRNA was lower in CIN than normal (p=0.04). IL-10 mRNA level in CIN was significantly higher (p=0.005) than in normal cervix (before microdissection). Epithelial IFN-gamma mRNA showed a significant decrease in all grades of CIN (median=3.58) compared with normal (7.74) (p<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the grades. A significant decrease in sub-epithelial IFN-gamma mRNA was found in CIN 1(9.81), CIN 2 (3.82) and CIN 3 (4.62) compared with normal cervix (27.35) (p<0.05). Also, sub-epithelial IFN-gamma mRNA was significantly lower in CIN 2 and CIN 3 than in CIN 1 (p=0.005 and 0.0005, respectively). IL-10 was detected in the epithelium of only one of 11 normal and one of 25 CIN, but sub-epithelial IL-10 was significantly higher in CIN 2 (0.08) and CIN 3 (0.26) than in normal (0.00) (p=0.036 and 0.0032, respectively). There was no significant difference in the sub-epithelial level of IL-10 between normal and CIN 1 (0.00) (p=0.96). Our results suggest that reduced epithelial and sub-epithelial IFN-gamma, as well as increased sub-epithelial IL-10 synthesis may play a role in the development and progression of HPV-16 associated cervical precancer.","Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","El-Sherif","A M","AM","Division of Pathology, Queens Medical Centre, University Hospital, Nottingham, UK. amiraelsherif@hotmail.com","","","Seth","R","R","","Tighe","P J","PJ","","Jenkins","D","D","","","eng","Journal Article","","","England","J Pathol","0204634","0022-3417","","0","RNA, Messenger","","0","RNA, Neoplasm","","130068-27-8","Interleukin-10","","82115-62-6","Interferon-gamma","","","IM","Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia","immunology","pathology","virology","","Cervix Uteri","immunology","","Disease Progression","","Epithelium","immunology","","Female","","Humans","","Interferon-gamma","biosynthesis","genetics","","Interleukin-10","biosynthesis","genetics","","Papillomaviridae","classification","isolation & purification","","RNA, Messenger","genetics","","RNA, Neoplasm","genetics","","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","","Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","immunology","pathology","virology","","","","2001","10","10","10","0","","2001","10","26","10","1","","2001","10","10","10","0","","","ppublish","11592096","10.1002/path.929","10.1002/path.929","",""

To address this further, we examined in detail the IHL from HCV-infected patients and controls, focusing on the antigen-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte component. Individual T cells from needle liver biopsies and peripheral blood were isolated from patients with chronic HCV infection and examined directly ex vivo. We used RT-PCR spectratyping to compare the breadth of the T cell receptor usage in the liver in comparison with the peripheral blood, and applied MHC class I tetramer technology to investigate the numbers of HCV-specific CD8(+) cells in the two compartments. T cell receptor usage in the liver of HCV-infected patients was broad, comparable with that in the peripheral blood of the same patients. A much higher proportion of liver CD8(+) cells expressed receptors specific for HCV antigens compared with paired peripheral blood CD8(+) cells. A greater proportion of the liver tetramer-positive cells expressed the activation marker CD69, compared with those in the periphery or other CD8(+) cells in the liver. In the course of chronic HCV infection, HCV-specific CD8 cells, which have been recently activated, appear to accumulate specifically in the livers of infected patients but are present in much lower numbers in the peripheral circulation. Further studies are needed to determine the function of these cells and their role in protection and immunopathology.","","Grabowska","A M","AM","Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, School of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Nottingham University, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, GB. anna.grabowska@nottingham.ac.uk","","","Lechner","F","F","","Klenerman","P","P","","Tighe","P J","PJ","","Ryder","S","S","","Ball","J K","JK","","Thomson","B J","BJ","","Irving","W L","WL","","Robins","R A","RA","","","eng","Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","","","Germany","Eur J Immunol","1273201","0014-2980","","0","HLA-A2 Antigen","","0","RNA, Messenger","","0","Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell","","","IM","CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes","immunology","","Cells, Cultured","","Flow Cytometry","","HLA-A2 Antigen","analysis","immunology","","Hepacivirus","immunology","","Hepatitis C, Chronic","blood","immunology","","Humans","","Liver","immunology","","RNA, Messenger","analysis","genetics","","Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell","genetics","immunology","","Substrate Specificity","","T-Lymphocytes","immunology","","","","2001","8","14","10","0","","2001","9","14","10","1","","2001","8","14","10","0","","","ppublish","11500822","10.1002/1521-4141(200108)31:8<2388::AID-IMMU2388>3.0.CO;2-L","10.1002/1521-4141(200108)31:8&#60;2388::AID-IMMU2388&#62;3.0.CO;2-L","",""

A quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using an internal competitor was used to investigate these samples. From these samples, 15 PVR, 8 RD, and 8 MH were analysed for the protein levels of the same cytokines using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Spearman correlation was used to test any association between mRNA and cytokine protein levels, as an indicator of the contribution these cells make to the intravitreal cytokine milieu.","A strong correlation was found between mRNA and their respective cytokine levels (protein products) for IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, IL-1alpha, TNFalpha, IFNgamma (Spearman r = 0.83, 0.73, 0.67, 0.91, 0.73, and 0.73 respectively), but not for IL-12. The median levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and IFNgamma mRNA and their respective cytokines were significantly higher (p <0.05) in patients with PVR than in those with macular hole. There was no statistically significant difference in the median levels of IL-1alpha mRNA between PVR and MH but the cytokine IL-1alpha was detected at a significantly higher level in PVR compared with MH patients. Between PVR and RD patients, there was no statistically significant difference in mRNA levels for all the investigated cytokines (p >0.05) except for IL-6 where there was a statistical significance (p= 0.038). In contrast, the median levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1beta cytokines were significantly higher (p <0.05) in patients with PVR than in those with RD, whereas for IL-1alpha and IFNgamma no significant statistical difference was detected between PVR and RD patients (p >0.05). When results of RD and MH patients were compared, a statistical difference was only detected in mRNA levels of INFgamma (p = 0.008). However, no difference was detected for INFgamma (protein product) or for any of the other cytokines between RD and MH patients.","Levels of both protein and mRNA encoding IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and IFNgamma is significantly increased in vitreous samples from patients with PVR. The strong correlation between ELISA detectable cytokines (protein products) and their respective mRNA levels suggest that intravitreal, invasive cells are the major source of these cytokines, with the exception of IL-12. Cells invading the vitreous do not appear to locally produce IL-12 mRNA. This would appear to implicate cells peripheral to the vitreal mass as the major source of this cytokine.","","El-Ghrably","I A","IA","Larry A Donoso Laboratory for Eye Research, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Nottingham, UK.","","","Dua","H S","HS","","Orr","G M","GM","","Fischer","D","D","","Tighe","P J","PJ","","","eng","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","","","England","Br J Ophthalmol","0421041","0007-1161","","0","Cytokines","","0","Interleukin-1","","0","Interleukin-6","","0","Interleukin-8","","0","RNA, Messenger","","0","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","","187348-17-0","Interleukin-12","","82115-62-6","Interferon-gamma","","EC 2.4.2.8","Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase","","","IM","Curr Eye Res. 1994 Nov;13(11):791-8","7851114","","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1994 Mar;35(3):900-6","8125753","","Int Ophthalmol Clin. 1995 Winter;35(1):163-73","7751128","","Exp Eye Res. 1995 May;60(5):533-43","7615019","","Scand J Gastroenterol. 1995 May;30(5):456-63","7638572","","Curr Opin Ophthalmol. 1995 Jun;6(3):70-5","10150873","","Br J Ophthalmol. 1995 Oct;79(10):953-60","7488586","","Curr Eye Res. 1995 Nov;14(11):1045-53","8585935","","Arch Ophthalmol. 1997 Feb;115(2):237-41","9046259","","Eur J Ophthalmol. 1997 Jan-Mar;7(1):64-7","9101198","","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1997 Apr;38(5):824-33","9112977","","Am J Ophthalmol. 1997 May;123(5):599-606","9152065","","Ophthalmologica. 1997;211(4):223-5","9216011","","Eye (Lond). 1997;11 ( Pt 2):183-93","9349410","","Exp Eye Res. 1997 Dec;65(6):781-9","9441701","","Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1998 May 15;63(1-2):73-82","9656443","","Surv Ophthalmol. 1998 Jul-Aug;43(1):3-18","9716190","","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1999 Mar;40(3):705-12","10067974","","J Leukoc Biol. 1999 May;65(5):543-51","10331481","","Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 1994 Nov;232(11):646-51","7843589","","Br J Ophthalmol. 1999 Nov;83(11):1296-9","10535861","","Ophthalmology. 1987 Apr;94(4):327-32","3587912","","J Immunol. 1988 Apr 1;140(7):2193-6","2965182","","Br J Ophthalmol. 1988 Jul;72(7):498-510","3415942","","Ophthalmology. 1989 Jun;96(6):801-10","2662102","","Immunol Today. 1989 Sep;10(9):299-304","2686679","","Am J Pathol. 1990 Apr;136(4):745-50","2183623","","Annu Rev Immunol. 1990;8:253-78","2188664","","Ann Rheum Dis. 1990 Jun;49 Suppl 1:480-6","2197999","","FASEB J. 1990 Aug;4(11):2860-7","2199284","","Am J Ophthalmol. 1990 Dec 15;110(6):593-8","1701071","","Eur J Biochem. 1991 Nov 15;202(1):3-14","1657606","","Eye (Lond). 1991;5 ( Pt 6):686-93","1800167","","J Exp Med. 1992 Nov 1;176(5):1387-98","1357073","","Ophthalmology. 1992 Sep;99(9):1364-7","1407970","","Curr Eye Res. 1992 Nov;11(11):1031-9","1282856","","Gene. 1992 Dec 15;122(2):313-20","1487146","","Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Feb 11;21(3):577-83","8441670","","PCR Methods Appl. 1993 Feb;2(3):191-6","7680263","","Curr Eye Res. 1993 Mar;12(3):205-12","8482109","","Rev Prat. 1993 Mar 1;43(5):547-52","8341924","","Immunology. 1995 Feb;84(2):265-71","7751003","","","Adult","","Aged","","Aged, 80 and over","","Case-Control Studies","","Cytokines","metabolism","","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","","Female","","Humans","","Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase","metabolism","","Interferon-gamma","metabolism","","Interleukin-1","metabolism","","Interleukin-12","metabolism","","Interleukin-6","metabolism","","Interleukin-8","metabolism","","Male","","Middle Aged","","RNA, Messenger","","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","","Statistics, Nonparametric","","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","metabolism","","Vitreoretinopathy, Proliferative","immunology","pathology","","Vitreous Body","metabolism","","","PMC1723908","","2001","3","27","10","0","","2001","5","1","10","1","","2001","3","27","10","0","","","ppublish","11264138","PMC1723908","",""

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits epithelial proliferation and down-regulates transcription of E6/E7 genes of HPV. Altered TGF-beta expression may be important in carcinogenesis. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to investigate TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3 mRNA levels in nine specimens of normal cervix and 15 cervical precancers (eight HPV-positive, including five HPV 16-positive). Immunocytochemical expression of TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3 was examined in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) positive for HPV 16 (26), and in HPV-negative, normal ectocervical epithelium (9); reserve cell hyperplasia (12); and immature (7) and mature (15) squamous metaplasia. The intensity of staining for TGF-beta1 was measured using grey-scale image analysis. Microdissection was used to investigate epithelial and stromal (excluding crypts) levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA in HPV 16-positive cervical precancer. Normal cervix, including reserve cells and immature and mature metaplasia, showed strong immunocytochemical expression of all TGF-beta isoforms. Expression was decreased in the basal third of the epithelium in CIN 1, in the basal and middle thirds in CIN 2, and in all layers in CIN 3. Quantitative analysis of TGF-beta1 expression showed that the changes in CIN compared with normal ectocervix and mature metaplasia were statistically highly significant (p<0.001, ANOVA). TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3 mRNA levels showed a significant decrease only in the five HPV 16-positive CIN samples when compared with normal (p=0. 0034, 0.0033, and 0.029, respectively). TGF-beta mRNA levels in HPV 16-positive epithelium also decreased from normal through low-grade to high-grade precancer. Stromal TGF-beta1 was absent or very low compared with epithelial production and was not altered in HPV 16 precancer. Progressive loss of epithelial TGF-beta expression and synthesis may be important in HPV 16-associated human cervical carcinogenesis.","Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","El-Sherif","A M","AM","Division of Pathology, Queens Medical Centre, University Hospital, Nottingham, UK. mpxaelsh@unix.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk","","","Seth","R","R","","Tighe","P J","PJ","","Jenkins","D","D","","","eng","Journal Article","","","ENGLAND","J Pathol","0204634","0022-3417","","0","RNA, Messenger","","0","RNA, Neoplasm","","0","Transforming Growth Factor beta","","","IM","Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia","immunology","virology","","Epithelium","immunology","","Female","","Gene Expression","","Humans","","Papillomaviridae","classification","isolation & purification","","Precancerous Conditions","immunology","virology","","RNA, Messenger","genetics","","RNA, Neoplasm","genetics","","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","","Transforming Growth Factor beta","biosynthesis","genetics","","Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","immunology","virology","","","","2000","12","13","11","0","","2001","3","3","10","1","","2000","12","13","11","0","","","ppublish","11113867","10.1002/1096-9896(200012)192:4<494::AID-PATH760>3.0.CO;2-W","10.1002/1096-9896(200012)192:4<494::AID-PATH760>3.0.CO;2-W","",""

However, most effort has been directed towards capillary blood glucose monitoring techniques. The most common biochemical near-patient testing device is the dry reagent strip or 'dipstick' for urinalysis. This report describes a quality assurance programme for urinalysis, used in the wards and clinics of a district general hospital, and in some of the general practitioner surgeries within its catchment area. The project describes the preparation of an aqueous 'urine' sample, the design of a report form, the dispatch of the sample and report forms to the ward/clinic/health centre, the receipt and scoring of the returned results, and the assessment of the results, both in terms of management information and sources of error. Samples were spiked to give a target value midway between two colour blocks for each analyte. Results were scored as +/- 1 if adjacent colour block to the target, +/- 2 for results two colour blocks (error) and +/- 3 (gross error) for results three or more colour blocks from the target value. For urine glucose, results showed an overall 14.7% error and 2.6% gross error rate. Similar scoring gave the following error and gross error rates for the other analytes: bilirubin (1.0%, 3.3%); ketone (4.3%, 0.3%); specific gravity (13.4%, 3.1%); pH (11.2%, 6.5%); blood (7.7%, 2.9%); protein (9.7%, 2.3%); and nitrite (gross errors 4.9%). Investigation of the results of the programme showed four types of error in dipstick testing-timing, misalignment, misunderstanding and transcription. Analysis of the results showed a reduction in error rates when an electronic reader was used (errors 2.0%, gross errors 0.75%), compared to reading against the colour blocks on the side of the bottle (7.7%, 1.6%) or using the colour blocks on a flat card reader (7.4%, 1.7%). The report demonstrates the importance of a QA scheme in providing a reliable screening service. It gives confidence to the users of dipsticks, information on training needs to clinical managers, and an understanding of both types of error and how they can be reduced.","","Tighe","P","P","Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust, Musgrove Park Hospital, England, UK.","","","","eng","Journal Article","","","ENGLAND","Br J Biomed Sci","9309208","0967-4845","","0","Reagent Strips","","","IM","England","","Humans","","Point-of-Care Systems","standards","","Quality Assurance, Health Care","methods","","Reagent Strips","standards","","Urinalysis","standards","","","","1999","9","24","","1999","9","24","0","1","","1999","9","24","0","0","","","ppublish","10492909","",""

Intron spanning primers were designed for beta defensins 1 and 2, and alpha defensins 5 and 6. RT-PCR was performed on cornea, conjunctiva, and lacrimal gland samples, and reaction products were size fractionated and sequenced to confirm their identity. A monoclonal antibody was utilised for the detection of alpha defensins 1, 2, and 3 in tissue sections and in immunoblots of tears.","RT-PCR revealed beta defensin 1 message in samples of conjunctiva, cornea, and lacrimal gland. beta Defensin 2 message was detected in the conjunctiva and cornea but was absent from the lacrimal gland. alpha Defensin 5 and 6 message was absent in these tissues but alpha defensins 1, 2, and 3 were detected in normal tears, lacrimal gland, and inflamed conjunctiva by immunochemistry.","The data suggest the human eye innately produces a spectrum of antimicrobial defensin peptides.

To begin a precise study of the ontogeny of the marsupial Didelphis albiventris we have used cross-reactive polyclonal antibodies raised against evolutionarily highly conserved peptides which form part of the antigen specific receptor complexes of human differentiated lymphocytes. Moreover, because of antigen receptor conservation, the antibodies also recognise specifically the immunocompetent T and B lymphocytes of other species including those in the organs of the opossum. Use of the antipeptide antibodies together with other cross-reacting antibodies has allowed us to study the cellular immunology of T and B cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) during the development of thymus, skin, lymph nodes and spleen in the Brazilian white-belly opossum. The molecular nature and identity of the T cell antigens detected in opossum tissues were confirmed by immunoblotting. These findings indicate that it is now possible to exploit these antibody probes for comparative mammalian studies, and indeed to investigate interesting features of the opossum, such as reaction of the immature immune system of the pouch young to antigenic stimulation.","","Coutinho","H B","HB","Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalhäes/FIOCRUZ, Recife, Brazil.","","","Sewell","H F","HF","","Tighe","P","P","","King","G","G","","Nogueira","J C","JC","","Robalinho","T I","TI","","Coutinho","V B","VB","","Cavalcanti","V M","VM","","","eng","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","","","ENGLAND","J Anat","0137162","0021-8782","","0","Antibodies","","0","Antigens, CD3","","0","HLA-DR Antigens","","0","Peptides","","","IM","Arch Oral Biol. 1967 Feb;12(2):175-82","5228182","","J Immunol. 1972 Apr;108(4):941-6","5023178","","J Anat. 1982 Oct;135(Pt 3):601-13","7153176","","Tissue Antigens. 1986 Jul;28(1):41-5","3529495","","J Immunol. 1964 Jul;93:157-64","14214381","","Lab Anim Sci. 1991 Jun;41(3):227-32","1658459","","Eur J Immunol. 1992 Oct;22(10):2753-6","1396979","","Dev Comp Immunol. 1993 Nov-Dec;17(6):537-48","8299852","","J Clin Pathol. 1989 Nov;42(11):1194-200","2531171","","","Animals","","Antibodies","","Antigen-Presenting Cells","immunology","","Antigens, CD3","analysis","","B-Lymphocytes","immunology","","HLA-DR Antigens","analysis","","Immune System","growth & development","","Immunity, Cellular","","Immunoblotting","","Immunohistochemistry","","Lymph Nodes","growth & development","","Mesentery","","Opossums","growth & development","immunology","","Peptides","immunology","","Skin","growth & development","","Spleen","growth & development","","T-Lymphocytes","immunology","","Thymus Gland","growth & development","","","PMC1167347","","1995","8","1","","1995","8","1","0","1","","1995","8","1","0","0","","","ppublish","7591984","PMC1167347","",""

Phylogenetic analysis and comparison of both pBRM5 and pBRM42 with other members of the casein family revealed that the rabbit may be unique among mammals in expressing two alpha s2-casein genes.
