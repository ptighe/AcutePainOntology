Conversely a new generation of Component Resolved Diagnostic systems using pure proteins is highly specific and totally dependent on the availability of the protein in its recombinant or natural origin form. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a microarray test based on protein extracts of food components. Our approach relies on innovations on three different fronts: the novelty of using arrayed food samples sequentially extracted with detergent and chaotropic agents, the ability to measure four different Ig classes simultaneously and the ability to analyse the generated data via a suitable bioinformatics/statistical analysis interface. This approach combines high numerical power of microarrays with automation, high throughput analysis and enables detailed investigation of the Ig profiles to food antigens. The prototype shown contains extracts of approximately 350 food ingredients that cover most of the food products found in the UK. Here we showed that the use of a sequential extraction technique to solubilise and then denature food samples has its benefits in the assessment of variations in antigenicity when tested with human sera. A patient dependent degree of class specificity was observed with human sera (IgG specificity correlates well with IgA>IgM>IgE). Besides generating a simultaneous profile for IgA, IgM, IgG and IgE the array system has shown good discrimination between challenge responders in atopic and non-atopic individuals. Poly- and mono-specific IgE responders were easily identified. The mathematical modelling of specific IgE content showed good correlations when compared with established IgE antibody testing assay (UniCAP).

The effects of preservation and processing on amnion proteome were investigated, and the major proteins in the TRAM characterized using mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. This identified a spectrum of proteins including thrombospondin, mimecan, BIG-H3, and integrin alpha 6. Preservation compromises cellular viability resulting in selective elution of soluble cellular proteins, leaving behind extracellular matrix-associated and cell structural proteins. A number of key architectural proteins common to the architecture of the ocular surface were demonstrated in AM, which are involved in homeostasis and wound healing. Handling procedures alter the protein composition of amniotic membrane prepared for transplantation. Without standardization, there will be inter-membrane variation, which may compromise the desired therapeutic effect of transplant ready amniotic membrane.']}\n",
      "{'AbstractText': ['Interleukin-12 (IL-12, p70) a heterodimeric cytokine of p40 and p35 subunits, important for Th1-type immune responses, has been attributed a prominent role in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Recently, the related heterodimeric cytokine, IL-23, composed of the same p40 subunit as IL-12 and a unique p19 subunit, was shown to be involved in Th1 responses and EAE. We investigated whether astrocytes and microglia, CNS cells with antigen-presenting cell (APC) function can present antigen to myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive T cells, and whether this presentation is blocked with antibodies against IL-12/IL-23p40. Interferon (IFN)-gamma-treated APC induced proliferation of MBP-reactive T cells. Anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibodies blocked this proliferation. These results support and extend our previous observation that astrocytes and microglia produce IL-12/IL-23p40. Moreover, we show that stimulated astrocytes and microglia produce biologically active IL-12p70. Because IL-12 and IL-23 share p40, we wanted to determine whether astrocytes also express IL-12p35 and IL-23p19, as microglia were already shown to express them. Astrocytes expressed IL-12p35 mRNA constitutively, and IL-23 p19 after stimulation. Thus, astrocytes, under inflammatory conditions, express all subunits of IL-12/IL-23. Their ability to present antigen to encephalitogenic T cells can be blocked by neutralizing anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibodies.']}\n",
