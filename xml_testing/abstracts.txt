The purpose of this study was to explore the role of visual and proprioceptive feedback in upper limb posture control in fibromyalgia (FM) and to assess the coherence between acceleration measurements of upper limb micro movements and surface electromyography (sEMG) of shoulder muscle activity (upper trapezius and deltoid). Twenty-five female FM patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) performed three precision motor tasks: (1) maintain a steady shoulder abduction angle of 45Â° while receiving visual feedback about upper arm position and supporting external loads (0.5, 1, or 2kg), (2) maintain the same shoulder abduction angle without visual feedback (eyes closed) and no external loading, and (3) a joint position sense test (i.e., assessment of proprioceptive accuracy). Patients had more extensive increase in movement variance than HCs when visual feedback was removed (P<0.03). Proprioceptive accuracy was related to movement variance in HCs (Râ©¾0.59, Pâ©½0.002), but not in patients (Râ©½0.25, Pâ©¾0.24). There was no difference between patients and HCs in coherence between sEMG and acceleration data. These results may indicate that FM patients are more dependent on visual feedback and less reliant on proprioceptive information for upper limb posture control compared to HCs.PURPOSE: While previous research suggests that lubricant use may be common among lesbian- and bisexually-identified women, it remains unclear from this research whether lubricant was being used with a male or female partner. The present study explores the behavioral, emotional, situational, and relational aspects of lesbian- and bisexually-identified women's lubricant use during their most recent female-partnered sexual event. METHODS: Nationally representative data was collected as part of the 2012 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB). The 2012 NSSHB had an oversample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. Participants were included in the present study if they identified as a lesbian or bisexual women and indicated that their most recent sexual partner was a female. Participants were asked a variety of questions about the context and experience of lubricant use during this event. RESULTS: Nearly a quarter (21.9%, n=32) of the participants reported that they used a lubricant during their most recent female-partnered sexual event. The likelihood of lubricant use significantly differed based upon age, race/ethnicity and sexual identity. The most commonly reported reason for lubricant use was to "make sex more comfortable," with half reporting use for clitoral stimulation (50.6%, n=16). Overall, participants indicated that lubricant use enhanced their sexual experience. CONCLUSION: Lubricant use may improve comfort and increase pleasure during certain sexual acts between women. The use of lubrication should be considered as a means of reducing pain and enhancing sexual pleasure during sexual behavior between women.PURPOSE: To assess the health and well-being of sexual minority women (SMW) with disabilities. METHODS: A survey assessing physical and mental health and quality of life was administered to a convenience sample of 52 women with disabilities and 74 without disabilities. All had been recruited for an SMW's health intervention targeting women over 40 with potential for weight-related health problems. RESULTS: Women with disabilities experienced more discrimination, had more posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, were less connected to SMW's communities, had more physical health limitations, and reported poorer quality of life, mostly related to physical factors such as energy level and pain. CONCLUSION: SMW with disabilities have rarely been studied, and may have significant challenges with health, including greater need for community support. Studies are needed to further explore the influences on the health and well-being of SMW with disabilities.PURPOSE: To compare same-day pain control and safety of 2 different anesthetic gels utilizing 5% and 2% lidocaine gel. Main outcome is to determine whether 5% lidocaine gel is more effective in decreasing pain during conjunctival clamping compared to 2% lidocaine gel 5 and 10âmin after gel application. METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized double-blind clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive 2% or 5% lidocaine gel in each eye. Discomfort during the gel instillation and pain during conjunctival clamping 5 and 10âmin after gel application were compared. Extend of corneal conjunctival staining was graded according to the Oxford scale. RESULTS: Eighty eyes of 40 patients were enrolled. The groups were similar in gender, with a mean age of 48âÂ±â16.26 years. The 5% lidocaine gel resulted in higher discomfort during initial instillation (Pâ=â0.092), however, the pain during conjunctival clamping was lower in the 5% lidocaine gel eyes (Pâ=â0.564) in both, 5 and 10âmin later (Pâ<â0.001). The majority of patients (80%) had no corneal conjunctival dye staining. The tear break-up time was not statistically different after lidocaine gel 2% (20.35âÂ±â7.37âs) and lidocaine 5% (19.75âÂ±â7.00âs). CONCLUSION: Five percent and 2% lidocaine gel have similar efficacy controlling pain 5âmin after instillation, however, 5% lidocaine gel appears to be more effective with a longer duration of action, without corneal toxicity. There was no corneal toxicity noted with either concentration.BACKGROUND: House dust mite (HDM) immunotherapy has proven efficacy in treating allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms. This trial evaluated the dose-response relationship of SLIToneULTRAÂ® HDM mix based on immunological parameters and safety in subjects with moderate-to-severe HDM AR not controlled by symptomatic medication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, parallel-group, open-label, clinical trial compared 50/150/300 standard reactivity unit (SRU) doses of SLIToneULTRAÂ® HDM mix for 6 months. Subjects had moderate-to-severe HDM AR, positive skin prick and IgE against Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus/Dermatophagoides farinae (DP/DF). The primary end point was change from baseline in the IgE-blocking factor against DP after 6 months. Secondary end points measured changes in the IgE-blocking factor for DP at 3 months and for DF at 3 and 6 months, and in IgG4 and specific IgE to DP/DF after 3 and 6 months. Tolerability was assessed through the evaluation of all adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: A total of 219 subjects were randomized and 196 completed the trial. Dose effect was significant on DP IgE-BF after 6 months (p = 0.018). The change in the DP IgE-blocking factor at a 300-SRU dose was higher than at other doses after 3 (p = 0.008) and 6 (p = 0005) months of treatment. Similar changes were observed for IgG4 and allergen-specific IgE. The number of AEs increased with the dose and were mild-to-moderate, with no severe treatment-related AEs reported. The most frequent AEs were oral/tongue pruritus, mouth oedema and abdominal upper pain. CONCLUSIONS: Data showed a dose-response for immunological markers and safety with a better immunological response for 300 SRU. The highest dose (300 SRU daily) was considered as the optimal maintenance dose.A 56-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of throat swelling and pain and difficulty breathing that was exacerbated by supine positioning; he had not had any obvious antecedent trauma. His medical history included prostate cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, deep-vein thrombosis, and stroke. Medications included warfarin (presumably for deep-vein thrombosis), antihypertensive agents, and a statin. He was afebrile, and the physical examination was notable for minor swelling of the posterior oropharynx. Laboratory studies revealed a normal white-cell count, an international normalized ratio of more than 11, a prothrombin time of more than 120 seconds, and an activated .Â .Â .A 38-year-old man presented with worsening abdominal pain, vomiting, anorexia, generalized weakness, and weight loss that had begun 3 days earlier. He had a history of eating raw beef. Examination of stool showed an embryonated egg containing an oncosphere.Background Effective and safe treatments are needed for patients who have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea. We conducted two phase 3 trials to assess the efficacy and safety of eluxadoline, a new oral agent with mixed opioid effects (Î¼- and Îº-opioid receptor agonist and Î´-opioid receptor antagonist), in patients with IBS with diarrhea. Methods We randomly assigned 2427 adults who had IBS with diarrhea to eluxadoline (at a dose of 75 mg or 100 mg) or placebo twice daily for 26 weeks (IBS-3002 trial) or 52 weeks (IBS-3001 trial). The primary end point was the proportion of patients who had a composite response of decrease in abdominal pain and improvement in stool consistency on the same day for at least 50% of the days from weeks 1 through 12 and from weeks 1 through 26. Results For weeks 1 through 12, more patients in the eluxadoline groups (75 mg and 100 mg) than in the placebo group reached the primary end point (IBS-3001 trial, 23.9% with the 75-mg dose and 25.1% with the 100-mg dose vs. 17.1% with placebo; P=0.01 and P=0.004, respectively; IBS-3002 trial, 28.9% and 29.6%, respectively, vs. 16.2%; P<0.001 for both comparisons). For weeks 1 through 26, the corresponding rates in IBS-3001 were 23.4% and 29.3% versus 19.0% (P=0.11 and P<0.001, respectively), and the corresponding rates in IBS-3002 were 30.4% and 32.7% versus 20.2% (P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). The most common adverse events associated with 75 mg of eluxadoline and 100 mg of eluxadoline, as compared with placebo, were nausea (8.1% and 7.5% vs. 5.1%), constipation (7.4% and 8.6% vs. 2.5%), and abdominal pain (5.8% and 7.2% vs. 4.1%). Pancreatitis developed in 5 (2 in the 75-mg group and 3 in the 100-mg group) of the 1666 patients in the safety population (0.3%). Conclusions Eluxadoline is a new therapeutic agent that reduced symptoms of IBS with diarrhea in men and women, with sustained efficacy over 6 months in patients who received the 100-mg dose twice daily. (Funded by Furiex Pharmaceuticals, an affiliate of Allergan; IBS-3001 and IBS-3002 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01553591 and NCT01553747 , respectively.).A retrospective study was conducted to review incidence, clinical practice, surgical management and histology of adolescent ovarian masses in order to audit and improve future practices. Complete hospital records of all adolescents between 10 and 20 years who had undergone surgery for ovarian masses were analysed between November 2006 to 2014. Parameters analysed were age, clinical features, diagnosis, operative procedure and histopathology. Ninety-four patients were included in the study and among them, 37 had non-neoplastic masses, 30 had benign neoplasms while 27 had malignant tumors. The main clinical presentations were abdominal pain (54%) and abdominal mass (41%). Dermoid was the most common benign neoplasm while germ cell tumor was the most common malignant mass; dysgerminoma being the commonest (68%). Malignancy was more common in early adolescence (12âÂ±â4.8 years) while non-neoplastic masses were seen more frequently in late adolescence (17.7âÂ±â2.2 years). There was a fair correlation between ultrasound and histopathological diagnosis.BACKGROUND: Despite previous efforts to explain the general advantages of female fetuses over males regarding health, sex-related differences in the dynamics or complexity of fetal heart rate (FHR) variability and FHR maturation patterns have not yet been identified. AIM: To make linear and nonlinear comparisons of antepartum FHR indices, dynamics, complexity, and reactivity to the non-stress test (NST) and vibroacoustic-stimulation test (VAST) in male and female fetuses. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 3835 singleton term deliveries without maternal and fetal complications were divided into female (n=1849) and male (n=1986) groups, and subjected to comparison and analyses. SUBJECTS: Linear FHR indices, approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), short-term/long-term exponents (Î±1/Î±2), correlation dimension (CD), NST and VAST criteria, and modified nonlinear reactive criteria (MNRC) were used to evaluate outcomes. RESULTS: ApEn was consistently higher in female fetuses than in male ones. ApEn in female fetuses was maximal at 29-30 gestational weeks, while the increase in ApEn was delayed in male fetuses but more rapid, reaching its peak at 31-32 gestational weeks. In both sexes, CD increased up to term, and Î±2 rapidly decreased up to 31-32weeks in an analogous manner. The two sexes differed significantly in response to VAST at <31 gestational weeks and there was a structural difference in reactive patterns under MNRC. CONCLUSIONS: Female fetuses exhibit greater heart rate dynamics in early gestational periods, suggesting that their cardiovascular system matures earlier than that of males. Male fetuses undergo a compensatory period of rapid change to catch up with females at term.OBJECTIVES: To clarify the pathophysiological factor underlying neural crosstalk among pelvic organs, we investigated the possible role of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the neural crosstalk between the testes and urinary bladder. METHODS: Nerve growth factor (10, 30, and 100âÂµg/mL) or saline was injected into the testes of male Wistar rats. The change in bladder capacity via cystometry and duration of spontaneous scratching behavior induced by NGF in conscious rats was measured. The effects of pretreatment with capsaicin on NGF-induced changes in bladder capacity and behavior were examined. Further, we evaluated the effect of analgesics, indomethacin and morphine, and pretreatment with compound 48/80 on NGF-induced scratching behavior to elucidate the mechanism of the behavior. RESULTS: Injection of saline into the testes had no effect on bladder capacity or behavior. However, an injection of NGF (30 and 100âÂµg/mL) reduced bladder capacity, which was regarded as bladder overactivity, and evoked scratching behavior in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with capsaicin inhibited NGF-induced bladder overactivity and scratching behavior. Neither indomethacin nor pretreatment with compound 48/80 affected the scratching behavior, but morphine inhibited the behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence of a possible new role of NGF in the testes regarding the activation of testicular primary afferent neurons mediated by capsaicin-sensitive C-fibers, which evokes bladder overactivity via neural crosstalk between the testes and the urinary bladder as well as testicular pain.INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to quantify the effect of exercise-induced muscle damage on both the electrochemical and mechanical components of electromechanical delay using very high frame rate ultrasound. METHODS: Fifteen participants underwent electrically-evoked contractions of the medial gastrocnemius muscle with an ultrasound transducer on the muscle belly and on the myotendinous junction, before, 1 hour, and 48 hours after eccentric exercise of the plantarflexor muscles. RESULTS: Maximal isometric plantarflexor torque was significantly lower at 1 hour (-41.1Â±14.9%; P=0.0001) and 48 hours post-exercise (-11.9Â±14.9%; P=0.038) than pre-exercise values. However, the delay between electrical stimulation and the onset of muscle activation, the delay between electrical stimulation and myotendinous junction motion, and the electromechanical delay were not altered significantly by eccentric exercise (P=0.063). DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that moderate muscle damage does not affect the time for the electrochemical or mechanical components of electromechanical delay.

Eysenck suggests that different personality types show different attentional biases to threatening information. This study is the first to test Eysenck's theory within a chronic back pain population by investigating the attentional biases of four different personality types using a back pain specific dot-probe paradigm. Participants were 70 volunteers (45 female) recruited from a back rehabilitation program at an NHS Trust. The four groups were selected on their trait anxiety and defensiveness scores: defensive high-anxious; high-anxious; repressor and non-extreme. Participants completed a dot probe task comprising 20 practice trials and 250 experimental trials. The experimental trials contained 100 threat-neutral pairs, 100 positive-neutral pairs and 50 neutral-neutral image pairings. The threat images were taken from the Photograph Series of Daily Activities (PHODA) and the neutral and positive images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) image bank. The results provided partial support for Eysenck's theory; defensive high-anxious individuals showed an attentional bias for threatening information compared to high-anxious individuals who demonstrated no bias. Repressors showed an avoidant bias to threatening images and an attentional bias to positive stimuli relative to neutral images. The clear difference in responses demonstrated by high-anxious individuals who vary in defensiveness highlight the need for separate investigation of these heterogeneous groups and help to explain the cognitive processes of defensive high-anxious individuals within a pain population. The demonstration of an attentional bias in this group to threatening information could explain why defensive high-anxious individuals are more likely to re-present for treatment.PMID: 26789435  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]BACKGROUND: Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is described as chronic pelvic pain (CPP) arising from dilated and refluxing pelvic veins, although the causal relationship between pelvic vein incompetence (PVI) and CPP is not established. Non-invasive screening methods such as Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance venography are used before confirmation by venography. Percutaneous embolisation has become the principal treatment for PCS, with high success rates often cited. OBJECTIVES: Our proposal aimed to systematically and critically review the definitions and diagnostic criteria of PCS, the association between PVI and CPP, the accuracy of various non-invasive imaging techniques and the effectiveness of embolisation for PVI; and to identify factors associated with successful outcome. We also wished to survey clinicians and patients to assess awareness and management of PCS and gauge the enthusiasm for further research. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search strategy encompassing various terms for pelvic congestion, pain, imaging techniques and embolisation was deployed in 17 bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. There was no restriction on study design. METHODS: Methodological quality was assessed using appropriate tools. Online surveys were sent to clinicians and patients. The quality and heterogeneity generally precluded meta-analysis and so results were tabulated and described narratively. RESULTS: We identified six association studies, 10 studies involving ultrasound, two studies involving magnetic resonance venography, 21 case series and one poor-quality randomised trial of embolisation. There were no consistent diagnostic criteria for PCS. We found that the associations between CPP and PVI were generally fairly similar, with three of five studies with sufficient data showing statistically significant associations (odds ratios of between 31 and 117). The prevalence of PVI ranged widely, although the majority of women with PVI had CPP. Transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler and magnetic resonance venography are both useful screening methods, although the data on accuracy are limited. Early substantial relief from pain symptoms was observed in approximately 75% of women undergoing embolisation, a figure which generally increased over time and was sustained. Reintervention rates were generally low. Transient pain was a common occurrence following foam embolisation, while there was a <â2% risk of coil migration. Confidence in the embolisation technique is reasonably high, although there is a desire to strengthen the evidence base. Even among women with CPP, fewer than half had any knowledge about PCS. CONCLUSIONS: The data supporting the diagnosis and treatment of PCS are limited and of variable methodological quality. There is some evidence to tentatively support a causative association, but it cannot be categorically stated that PVI is the cause of CPP in women with no other pathology, as the six most pertinent drew on clinically disparate populations and defined PVI inconsistently. Embolisation appears to provide symptomatic relief in the majority of women and is safe. However, the majority of included studies of embolism were relatively small case series and only the randomised controlled trial was considered at risk of potential biases. There is scope and demand for considerable further research. The question of the association of PVI and CPP requires a well-designed and well-powered case-control study, which will also provide data to derive a diagnostic standard. An adequately powered randomised trial is essential to provide evidence on the effectiveness of embolisation, but this faces methodological challenges.

The second premolar (tooth 45) was diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. The radiographic examination revealed a dilacerated s-shaped root configuration, with 2 severe curvatures of less than 2 mm radius. Under local anaesthesia and rubber dam isolation, a glide path was created until a size 10 K-file reached working length. Instrumentation to larger size was achieved with a novel approach using controlled memory files. The controlled memory files were precurved and passively inserted below the curvature until maximum frictional resistance. The motor was activated by maintaining light apical pressure and the files were withdrawn from the canal. This procedure was repeated until each file could reach the working length. Chemical disinfection was achieved with positive syringe irrigation of 6% NaOCl, followed by 17% EDTA rinsing and manual dynamic gutta-percha activation of the irrigants. Canal filling was achieved using the continuous wave of condensation technique and thermoplasticized injectable gutta-percha backfill. The postoperative radiography revealed that the initial canal anatomy of the dilacerated double curved root canal was preserved. This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of this study is to characterize the percutaneous absorption of 2 ketoprofen formulations (ketoprofen 10% in Pluronic Lecithin Organogel (PLO) and ketoprofen 10% in Lipoderm, referred to as Phospholipid Base), when applied to the human cadaver trunk skin, in vitro, using the Franz skin finite dose model. PLO and Phospholipid Base are vehicles used to facilitate the delivery of drugs into and through the skin following topical applications. METHODS: The percutaneous absorption of ketoprofen was evaluated using human cadaver trunk skin from 3 donors. The skin was cut into small sections and cultured within Franz diffusion cells. A variable finite dose of each formulation was then applied to 3 replicate skin sections per donor and receptor solutions were collected at predetermined time points (0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 32, and 48 hr). After the last receptor sample was collected, skin surfaces were washed and split into epidermis and dermis. Collected samples were analyzed using HPLC. RESULTS: Both PLO and Phospholipid Base were capable of facilitating the absorption of ketoprofen across human cadaver trunk skin. However, ketoprofen, when in Phospholipid Base, showed higher mean total absorption (p=0.022) and faster rate of absorption (p<0.05 at 2, 6, 10, and 18 hr) than when in PLO. CONCLUSION: Chronic musculoskeletal pain can be a major burden for most patients, affecting their lifestyle and reducing overall quality of life. When compared to PLO, Phospholipid Base has the ability to potentially deliver higher concentrations of ketoprofen to underlying soft tissues and at a more rapid rate. With more ketoprofen at the site of injury, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects will likely be enhanced, potentially reducing pain and improving quality of life.AIM: During the last decades, therapies targeting cervical cancer have been considerably improved. Surgery and radiotherapy (RT) represent the main common therapeutic approach in cervical cancer. In order to minimize the side effects of radiotherapy approach, several protocols have been developed such as brachytherapy (BRT). Among the side effects associated with RT, the vaginal atrophy is the most important and common one. Vaginal atrophy, in turn, leads to additional alterations like inflammation, associated to relevant symptoms such as itching, burning and dyspareunia. All these alterations heavily affect the quality of women's life. The aim of our study was to evaluate the toxicity induced by RT on vaginal mucosa, and the adjuvant action of a product containing LMWHA, vitamin A, and Vitamin E (SantesÂ®, Lo.Li. Pharma, Rome, Italy). The introduction of adjuvant therapies may have likely had a relevant place in providing that result. METHODS: A prospective randomized study was designed. From October 2006 to October 2008, 45 women with a mean age 38Â±6 years were enrolled. After surgery, all patients were treated with 4 weeks of RT and 4 weeks of BRT, concomitantly with chemiotherapy. They were randomly assigned in two groups: 23 women were treated with two suppositories (SantesÂ®) per day for 4 months. For the first two months the preventive treatment was simultaneous to RT and BRT. Instead the control groups for composed by 22 patients and they did not undergo any treatment during RT. To evaluate the efficacy of SantesÂ® treatment three biopsies were performed. RESULTS: At the second biopsy, after the BRT therapy, the treated group showed a statistically significant improvement (P<0.05 vs. control) on inflammation, cell atypia, fibrosis, mucositis and bleeding. At the third biopsy, two months after BRT, further statistically improvement were observed for all RT/BRT associated side effects. The treatment showed an efficacy also in terms of pain severity. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that low molecular weight HA shows good performances in treating RT-damaged tissue and plays a key role in all steps of the healing process. Indeed the results shows that women exposed to RT treatments and simultaneously treated with SantesÂ®, had an optimal resolution of vaginal atrophy and related symptoms.PMID: 26788862  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]BACKGROUND: An order protocol for distress (OPD), including respiratory distress and acute pain crisis, has been established for pediatric palliative care patients at Sainte-Justine Hospital (SJH). After discussion with the patient/his or her family, the OPD is prescribed by the attending physician whenever judged appropriate. The OPD can then be initiated by the bedside nurse when necessary; the physician is notified after the first dose is administered. OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to evaluate the perceptions and experience of the medical/nursing staff towards the use of the OPD. METHODS: A survey was distributed to all physicians/nurses working on wards with pediatric palliative care patients. Answers to the survey were anonymous, done on a voluntary basis, and after consent of the participant. RESULTS: Surveys (258/548) were answered corresponding to a response rate of 47%. According to the respondents, the most important motivations in using the OPD were the desire to relieve patient's distress and the speed of relief of distress by the OPD; the most important obstacles were going against the patient's/his or her family's wishes and fear of hastening death. The respondents reported that the OPD was frequently (56%) or always (36%) effective in relieving the patient's distress. The respondents felt sometimes (16%), frequently (34%), or always (41%) comfortable in giving the OPD. They thought the OPD could never (12%), rarely (32%), sometimes (46%), frequently (8%), or always (1%) hasten death. Physicians were less favorable than nurses with the autonomy of bedside nurses to initiate the OPD before notifying the physician (pâ=â0.04). Overall, 95% of respondents considered that they would use the OPD in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this survey shows that respondents are in favor of using the OPD at SJH and find it effective. Further training as well as support for health care professionals are mandatory in such palliative care settings.PMID: 26788763  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]Chronic pain is an important public health problem that negatively impacts quality of life of affected individuals and exacts enormous socio-economic costs. Chronic pain is often accompanied by comorbid emotional disorders including anxiety, depression and possibly anhedonia. The neural circuits underlying the intersection of pain and pleasure are not well understood. We summarize recent human and animal investigations demonstrating that aversive aspects of pain are encoded in brain regions overlapping with areas processing reward and motivation. We highlight findings revealing anatomical and functional alterations of reward/motivation circuits in chronic pain. Finally, we review supporting evidence for the concept that pain relief is rewarding and activates brain reward/motivation circuits. Adaptations in brain reward circuits may be fundamental to the pathology of chronic pain. Knowledge of brain reward processing in the context of pain could lead to the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of emotional aspects of pain and comorbid conditions.

Most of these neoplasms have a high tendency for recurrence, local infiltration, perineural extension, and metastasis. Although uncommon, these malignant tumors require complex surgical treatment sometimes involving a total parotidectomy including a complete facial nerve resection. Severe functional and aesthetic facial defects are the result of a complete sacrifice or injury to isolated branches becoming an uncomfortable distress for patients and a major challenge for reconstructive surgeons. CASE REPORT: A case of a 54-year-old, systemically healthy male patient with a 4 month complaint of pain and swelling on the right side of the face is presented. The patient reported a rapid increase in the size of the lesion over the past 2 months. Imaging tests and histopathological analysis reported an adenoid cystic carcinoma. A complete parotidectomy was carried out with an intraoperative notice of facial nerve infiltration requiring a second intervention for nerve and defect reconstruction. A free ALT flap with vascularized nerve grafts was the surgical choice. A 6 month follow-up showed partial facial movement recovery and the facial defect mended. CONCLUSION: It is of critical importance to restore function to patients with facial nerve injury. Vascularized nerve grafts, in many clinical and experimental studies, have shown to result in better nerve regeneration than conventional non-vascularized nerve grafts. Nevertheless, there are factors that may affect the degree, speed and regeneration rate regarding the free fasciocutaneous flap. In complex head and neck defects following a total parotidectomy, the extended free fasciocutaneous ALT (anterior-lateral thigh) flap with a vascularized nerve graft is ideally suited for the reconstruction of the injured site. Donor-site morbidity is low and additional surgical time is minimal compared with the time of a single ALT flap transfer.INTRODUCTION: Tonsillectomy is the one of the most common types of surgery in children, and is often accompanied by post-operative pain and discomfort. Methods of pain control such as use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), narcotics, and local anesthetics have been used, but each have their own particular side effects. In this study we investigated the effect of ketamine on post-operative sedation and pain relief. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 children aged between 5 and 12 years who were candidates for tonsillectomy were divided into two groups. The study group received ketamine-midazolam (ketamine 1 mg/kg, midazolam 0.1 mg/kg) and the control group received midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) in the pre-operative period. The same methods ofÂ anesthesia induction and maintenance were used in all patients. Pain score was assessed using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating scale and sedation was evaluated using the Riker Sedation-Agitation scale at the time of extubation as well as 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, and 6 hours after surgery. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in terms of age, weight, gender and duration of surgery. Pain after 15 and 30 minutes and agitation after 10 and 15 minutes following extubation were lower in the study group (ketamine-midazolam). Mean consumption and time of first request for analgesia after surgery as well as incidence of post-operative vomiting were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Adding ketamine to midazolam in pre-operative of tonsillectomy reduces agitation and post-operative pain in the first 30 minutes after surgery.INTRODUCTION: Controversy remains as to the advantages and disadvantages of pharyngeal packing during septorhinoplasty. Our study investigated the effect of pharyngeal packing on postoperative nausea and vomiting and sore throat following this type of surgery or septorhinoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This clinical trial was performed on 90 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I or II patients who were candidates for septorhinoplasty. They were randomly divided into two groups. Patients in the study group had received pharyngeal packing while those in the control group had not. The incidence of nausea and vomiting and sore throat based on the visual analog scale (VAS) was evaluated postoperatively in the recovery room as well as at 2, 6 and 24 hours. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was 12.3%, with no significant difference between the study and control groups. Sore throat was reported in 50.5% of cases overall (56.8% on pack group and 44.4% on control). Although the severity of pain was higher in the study group at all times, the incidence in the two groups did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION: The use of pharyngeal packing has no effect in reducing the incidence of nausea and vomiting and sore throat after surgery. Given that induced hypotension is used as the routine method of anesthesia in septorhinoplasty surgery, with a low incidence of hemorrhage and a high risk of unintended retention of pharyngeal packing, its routine use is not recommended for this procedure.INTRODUCTION: Deep neck space infections (DNSI) are serious diseases that involve several spaces in the neck. The common primary sources of DNSI are dental infections, tonsillar and salivary gland infections, malignancies, and foreign bodies. With widespread use of antibiotics, the prevalence of DNSI has been reduced. Common complications of DNSI include airway obstruction, jugular vein thrombosis, and sepsis. Treatment principally comprises airway management, antibiotic therapy, and surgical intervention. This study was conducted to investigate the age and sex distribution of patients, symptoms, presentation, sites involved, bacteriology, and management and complications of DNSI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was performed from October 2010 to January 2013, and included 76 patients with DNSI. Patients of all age groups and gender were included. All parameters including age, gender, co-morbidities, presentation, site, bacteriology, complications, and required interventions were studied. RESULTS: In our study, the majority of patients were in the 31-50-year age group. Males accounted for 55.26% of the sample and females for 44.74%, with a male:female ratio of 1.23. Most of the patients were from a rural background. Diabetes was found as a co-morbid condition in 10.52% cases. Neck pain was the most common symptom, identified in 89.47% cases. The most common etiological factor was odontogenic infection (34.21%), followed by tonsillar and pharyngeal infection (27.63%). The most common presentation was Ludwig's angina (28.94%), followed by peritonsillar abscess and submandibular abscess. In 50% of cases, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus were found in the culture. Surgical intervention was carried out in 89.47% cases. Emergency tracheotomy was required in 5.26% cases. CONCLUSION: DNSI can be life-threatening in diabetic patients, the immunocompromised, and elderly patients, and special attention should therefore be given to these groups. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to prevent complications. All patients must be treated initially with intravenous antibiotics, with treatment subsequently updated based on a culture and sensitivity report. Due to poor oral hygiene, lack of nutrition, smoking and chewing of beetle nut and tobacco, odontogenic infections are the most common cause of DNSI. Thus, DNSI could be prevented by making the population aware of dental and oral hygiene and offering regular check-ups for dental infections.AIM: To elucidate the clinical, radiological and laboratory proï¬les of renal abscess (RA) and perinephric abscess (PNA), along with related treatment and outcome. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients diagnosed with RA or PNA using the primary discharge diagnoses identified from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Tenth Edition (ICD-10) codes (RA: N15.101, PNA: N15.102) between September 2004 and December 2014 in West China Hospital were selected. Medical records including patients' characteristics, symptoms and signs, high-risk factors, radiological features, causative microorganisms and antibiotic-resistance proï¬les, treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 46.49 years with a male to female ratio of 41:57. Lumbar pain (76.5%) and fever (53.1%) were the most common symptoms. Other symptoms and signs included chills (28.6%), anorexia and vomiting (25.5%), lethargy (10.2%), abdominal pain (11.2%), flank mass (12.2%), flank fistula (2.0%), gross hematuria (7.1%), frequency (14.3%), dysuria (9.2%), pyuria (5.1%) and weight loss (1.0%). Painful percussion of the costovertebral angle (87.8%) was the most common physical finding. The main predisposing factors were lithiasis (48.0%), diabetes mellitus (33.7%) followed by history of urological surgery (16.3%), urinary tract infections (14.3%), renal function impairment (13.3%), liver cirrhosis (2.0%), neurogenic bladder (1.0%), renal cyst (1.0%), hydronephrosis (1.0%), chronic hepatitis B (1.0%), post-discectomy (1.0%) and post-colectomy (1.0%). Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography were the most valuable diagnostic tools and US was recommended as the initial diagnostic imaging choice. Escherichia coli (51.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.6%) were the main causative microorganisms. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was necessary while intervention including surgical and nonsurgical approaches were reserved for larger abscesses, multiple abscesses, PNAs and non-responders. CONCLUSION: Heightened alertness, prompt diagnosis, and especially proper antibiotics in conjunction with interventional approaches allow a promising clinical outcome of renal and perinephric abscesses.A 6-year-old girl presented with intermittent abdominal pain, without jaundice and a palpable mass in the epigastrium. Preoperative imaging and upper endoscopy suggested duodenal duplication. During surgery, the patient was diagnosed with a rare type of choledochal cyst-choledochocele (type 3b). The authors emphasize that, in children, choledochocele should be included in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions located in the duodenal area and the head of the pancreas area, regardless of jaundice or abnormal liver function. Since mucosal histology showing duodenal mucosa did not match the final diagnosis, we suggest that three criteria should be met for the diagnosis of a choledochocele to be diagnosed: (1) a cyst protruding into the duodenal lumen; (2) filling with contrast during cholangiography and (3) a filling defect on X-ray barium meal.We are hereby reporting a case where the eggs and adults of the mold mites; Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Shrank) and the trophozoites of Blastocystis sp. were found in stool of threeÂ years old child from Minia City, Egypt. Intestinal mite infection was diagnosed after repeated identification of mite' stages from six consecutive stool samples to exclude the possibilities of contamination and spurious infection. The patient was suffering from severe colicky abdominal pain and burning sensation around the anus oneÂ month ago. All other members of his family were having the same acarine in their feces, but were all symptomless. The patient was treated with ivermectin 200Â Âµg/kg body weight once every 10Â days for three doses. His cure indicated that he was having asymptomatic blastocystosis.A 70-year-old man presented with lower back pain and cyanotic changes in his left lower extremity. He was diagnosed with infected aortic aneurysm and infectious spondylitis. He had received intravesical Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) therapy up to 1 month before the onset of symptoms. The aneurysm was excised and an aorto-biiliac interposition graft was performed. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was cultured in the surgical specimens. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the senX3-regX3 region, and multiplex PCR using dual-priming oligonucleotide primers targeting the RD1 gene, revealed that the organism isolated was Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The patient took anti-tuberculosis medication for 1 year, and there was no evidence of recurrence at 18 months follow-up.BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved, and the adverse effects of antiretroviral drugs have been reduced. However, these adverse effects still significantly influence patient compliance, increasing the risk of tolerability failure. Therefore, we investigated the adverse effects and tolerability failure causing changes in the first ART regimen, and identified the regimens that were most vulnerable to switching. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who commenced their first ART between January 1, 2011 and July 30, 2014. Patients who started their first ART regimen at the Kyungpook National University Hospital were included in the study if they were aged â¥18 years and were followed-up for â¥12 weeks. The primary dependent variable was the duration of treatment on the same ART regimen. We analyzed the maintenance rate of the first ART regimen based on the treatment duration between these groups using survival analysis and log rank test. The frequency of the adverse effects of ART regimens was analyzed by multiple response data analysis. RESULTS: During the investigation period, 137 patients were enrolled. Eighty-one patients were maintained on the initial treatment regimen (59.1%). In protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen group, 54 patients were maintained on the initial treatment regimen (54/98, 55.1%). In non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-and integrase inhibitor (II)-based regimen group, 15 (15/26, 57.7%) and 12 (12/13, 92.3%) patients were maintained on the initial treatment regimen, respectively. Adverse effects that induced ART switching included rash (16/35, 45.7%), gastrointestinal discomfort or pain (7/35, 20%), diarrhea (7/35, 20%), hyperbilirubinemia (6/35, 17.1%), headache or dizziness (3/35, 8.5%). Among the treatment regimens, the group receiving an II-based regimen showed the least switching. The group receiving PI-and NRTI-based regimens were most likely to switch due to adverse effects during the early treatment period. However, after about 18 months, switching was rarely observed in these groups. Among the PI drugs, darunavir/ritonavir showed fewer drug changes than atazanavir/ritonavir (P = 0.004, log rank test) and lopinavir/ritonavir (P = 0.010). Among the NNRTI drugs, rilpivirne produced less switching than efavirenz (P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects to ART resulted in about a quarter of patients switching drugs during the early treatment period. II-based regimens were advantageous because they were less likely to induce switching within 18 months of treatment commencement. These findings indicated the importance of considering and monitoring the adverse effects of ART in order to improve adherence.Inferior vena cava agenesis (IVCA) is a rare congenital anomaly that can be asymptomatic or present with vague, nonspecific symptoms, such as abdominal or lower back pain, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Here, we present a 55-year-old male who came with painless swelling and redness of his left lower limb. On examination, swelling and redness were noted extending from the left foot to the upper thigh; it was also warm compared to his right lower limb. Venous Doppler ultrasound was done which showed DVT extending up to the common femoral vein. Subsequently, computed-tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen was done to exclude malignancy or venous flow obstruction; it revealed congenital absence (agenesis) of the infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC).Teratomas are unusual tumours that derived from totipotent cells with their origin from more than one or usually all three germ cells. Here authors are presenting a case of primary retroperitoneal tumour that is a rare clinical entity. A 19-year-old male presented with right lumbar pain and was found to have complex cyst with large calcification in right adrenal gland on imaging. Intraoperatively, he was found to have a solid mass with areas of soft consistency, which was excised en bloc. On gross examination, the cyst contained pieces of bone, few teeth, and hairs entangled in mucinous material. On histological evaluation, it was confirmed to be mature teratoma arising from the right adrenal gland. He made uneventful recovery and was kept well on annual follow-up.Subcutaneous emphysema is a known complication of carbon dioxide insufflation, an essential component of laparoscopy. The literature contains reports of hypercarbia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum. However, isolated lower extremity subcutaneous emphysema remains a seldom-reported complication. We report a case of unilateral lower extremity subcutaneous emphysema following robotic-assisted hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophorectomy, staging, and anterior/posterior colporrhaphy for carcinosarcoma and vaginal prolapse. On postoperative day 1, the patient developed tender crepitus and bruising of her right ankle. Radiography confirmed presence of subcutaneous air. Vital signs and laboratory findings were unremarkable. Her symptoms spontaneously improved over time, and she was discharged in good condition on day 2. In stable patients with postoperative extremity swelling or pain with crepitus on exam, the diagnosis of iatrogenic subcutaneous emphysema must be considered.Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is an extremely rare but life-threatening complication of the postpartum period. It has never been reported as a complication of laparoscopic surgery. We report a case of right ovarian vein thrombosis that occurred in the postoperative period after patient underwent laparoscopic salpingectomy for a right side ectopic pregnancy. She presented with 1-week history of abdominal pain and fever. A complete workup for fever was performed and was found negative. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed right ovarian vein thrombosis. The patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy and responded well.We describe an unusual case of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in a 55-year-old male presenting with isolated skeletal disease as the initial manifestation without abnormal peripheral blood counts, bone marrow involvement, or splenomegaly. To the best of our knowledge, there have been only two previous reports of a similar case. The patient presented with pain in the right femur. Anteroposterior radiographs of both femurs revealed mixed lytic-sclerotic lesions. PET scan showed multiple metastatic lesions on axial skeleton, pelvis, and both femurs. Histopathological examination of the bone biopsy revealed an infiltrate of HCL. Localized radiation therapy to both proximal femurs and subsequently 4 weeks later, a 7-day course of 0.1âmg/kg/day cladribine provided complete remission with relief of symptoms and resolution of bone lesions. We addressed the manifestations and management of HCL patients with skeletal involvement.Purpose. In knee osteoarthritis, the degree of pain varies despite similar imaging findings. If there were quantitative findings related to the pain of knee osteoarthritis, it could be used for diagnosis or screening. The medial meniscal extrusion was investigated as a candidate quantitative finding related to the pain of knee osteoarthritis. Methods. Seventy-six knees of 38 patients (mean age, 73 years) who received intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid into unilateral knees at the time of diagnosis of knee arthritis were investigated. Cartilage thickness of the femoral medial condyle and medial meniscal extrusion of bilateral knees were measured by ultrasonography. Thirty-eight knees that had hyaluronic acid injections were compared with 38 other side knees from the same patients as the control group. Results. The average cartilage thicknesses of the knees with pain that received intra-articular injections and the knees without pain that received no injections were 1.02 and 1.05âmm, respectively (P = 0.6394). On the other hand, the average medial meniscal extrusions of the knees with and without pain were 7.58 and 5.88âmm, respectively (P = 0.0005); pain was associated with greater medial meniscal extrusions. Conclusion. Medial meniscal extrusion is a quantitative finding related to the pain of knee osteoarthritis.Manual therapy has long been a component of physical rehabilitation programs, especially to treat those in pain. The mechanisms of manual therapy, however, are not fully understood, and it has been suggested that its pain modulatory effects are of neurophysiological origin and may be mediated by the descending modulatory circuit. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to examine the neurophysiological response to different types of manual therapy, in order to better understand the neurophysiological mechanisms behind each therapy's analgesic effects. It is concluded that different forms of manual therapy elicit analgesic effects via different mechanisms, and nearly all therapies appear to be at least partially mediated by descending modulation. Additionally, future avenues of mechanistic research pertaining to manual therapy are discussed.The motor imagery (MI) has been proposed as a treatment in the complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS-1), since it seems to promote a brain reorganization effect on sensory-motor areas of pain perception. The aim of this paper is to investigate, through an integrative critical review, the influence of MI on the CRPS-1, correlating their evidence to clinical practice. Research in PEDro, Medline, Bireme and Google Scholar databases was conducted. Nine randomized controlled trials (level 2), 1 non-controlled clinical study (level 3), 1 case study (level 4), 1 systematic review (level 1), 2 review articles and 1 comment (level 5) were found. We can conclude that MI has shown effect in reducing pain and functionality that remains after 6 months of treatment. However, the difference between the MI strategies for CRPS-1 is unknown as well as the intensity of mental stress influences the painful response or effect of MI or other peripheral neuropathies.The current study reports the case of a 61-year-old man with diabetes who was suffering from generalized pain over the whole body and gradually progressive numbness. The patient was initially diagnosed with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and received treatment, however, the symptoms persisted. In October 2010, the patient was admitted to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy General Hospital (Beijing, China) for the treatment of diabetes, however, a full-body sharp pain was also described, which was relieved upon massaging the area. Causes, other than diabetes, were investigated for these symptoms. Chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans revealed a mass shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung, with multiple lymphatic metastases. Lung cancer was diagnosed with a tumor-node-metastasis stage of T1N3Mx. Following treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the patient's symptoms were significantly improved. The present study reports a rare case of a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) that presented as painful neuropathy resulting from lung cancer, which mimicked diabetic peripheral neuropathy.Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare type of mesenchymal tumor, which may affect various organs. The preferential site for IMT in the genitourinary system is the urinary bladder, while the presence of IMT in the kidney, and particularly in the renal pelvis, is rare. In the present report, the case of a 43-year-old man who was admitted to the Department of Urology of The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha, China) in July 2012, with complaints of iterative gross hematuria and abdominal pain unresponsive to antibiotics is described. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indicated a slightly enhanced mass in the left renal pelvis of 1.5 cm in diameter. On request of the patient, a left nephrectomy was then performed, based on a suspected diagnosis of renal pelvic carcinoma. However, analysis of the intraoperative fast-frozen section exhibited proliferation of compact spindle cells, suggesting IMT. Therefore, further ureterectomy was avoided, and the patient remained in healthy condition thereafter.There is a low incidence of multiple primary cancer, particularly when the cancer is synchronous. The present report presents a case of synchronous double primary malignancies. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to Ling Nan Hospital (Guangzhou, China) complaining of pain in the left hip. X-ray revealed an osteolytic lesion and further examination indicated the presence of double primary cancer, consisting of hepatic cholangiocarcinoma and thyroid carcinoma. Biopsy of the osteolytic lesion showed a metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. Subsequently, final diagnosis was confirmed by I-131 scan and liver lesion biopsy. The patient received positive multidisciplinary treatments and survived for 9 months following diagnosis. The results of the present case suggest that multiplicity of primary malignancy is not necessarily an indicator of poor prognosis, as long as effective diagnosis and adequate disease management are achieved.As an uncommon subtype of meningioma, chordoid meningioma (CM) of the spinal canal is extremely rare. There have been only two reported cases of intraspinal CM in the literature, and this lesion has not been previously reported in the pediatric age group. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reports the first case of spinal chordoid meningioma in a pediatric patient. A 12-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of progressive numbness and weakness in the right-side limbs, and intermittent pain in the neck and right shoulder. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intraspinal lesion at the C2-3 level with irregularly heterogeneous enhancement. The patient underwent a C2-3 laminotomy. Due to adhesion to the dura and proximity to the vertebral artery, the tumor was partially removed intraoperatively. The post-operative course was uneventful and the symptoms were apparently relieved. The patient experienced recurrence 5 years subsequent to surgery. MRI revealed an extradural regrown tumor at the C2-5 level. Partial removal combined with radiotherapy was performed. However, the patient experienced progression of tetraplegia and succumbed to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure 5 months subsequent to the second surgery. In the present study, the clinicoradiological findings and treatment outcome of this rare entity are discussed, in addition to a review of the relevant literature. Spinal CMs should be included in the differential diagnosis of intraspinal tumors of the pediatric spine. Multidisciplinary treatment, consisting of total surgical removal and adjuvant radiotherapy, should be considered due to the aggressive nature of this abnormality and the risk of long-term recurrence.Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a soft-tissue tumor with a unique t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) chromosomal translocation that can be identified by polymerase chain reaction in tissue homogenates. Generally, the tumor occurs in the proximity of the joints. The current study presents the case of a 54-year-old female with primary SS (PSS) of the right kidney; this is an extremely rare tumor accounting for <2% of malignant renal carcinomas. The patient presented with an interrupted right flank pain of 20 years duration, with a precipitating factor of a hematuria of 8 days. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a heterogeneous, unclear-marginated soft tissue arising in the upper pole of the right kidney with solid, necrotic components and heterogeneous enhancement. Renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed pre-operatively. A right nephrectomy was performed, and the patient is currently free of metastasis 12 months after the surgery. The current treatment for renal SS includes surgical resection and ifosfamide-based chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, <50 cases have been reported in the English literature. Urologists should be aware of the possibility of malignancy in cystic renal masses and consider a diagnosis of SS. Along with the case report, the current study presents a literature review on the diagnosis and treatment of PSS.Reconstruction following periacetabular tumor resection of the pelvis is one of the most challenging issues in limb salvage surgery. An ideal procedure has still not been established. There are several reconstruction methods available, including arthrodesis, pseudoarthrosis, resection arthroplasty, prosthetic arthroplasty, saddle prosthesis, allograft and hip transposition. In our hospital, we have been using a flail hip joint procedure without reconstruction. Herein, we report good extremity function following a flail hip joint procedure which used the upper surface of the femoral neck as a saddle facing the remaining ilium. To the best of our knowledge, among the reported flail hip joint cases, this procedure has never been used. The patient is able to walk without any pain for several hundred meters with a shoe lift but without a cane, as observed at a 20-year follow-up. The authors consider that the flail hip joint using the upper surface of the femoral neck as a saddle is a simple and effective method.Clinical reports of kidney metastases derived from an invasive mole (IM) are rare. The present study presents the case of a 42-year-old woman who exhibited IM and bilateral kidneys metastases in what may be, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of such a case. Following an induced abortion, the patient initially experienced irregular vaginal bleeding and subsequently presented with left-sided waist and abdominal pain. The patient was admitted to hospital and was clinically diagnosed with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), as well as bilateral kidney metastases and a spontaneous rupture of the left kidney. This diagnosis was based on the patient's medical history, which comprised increased levels of human chorionic gonadotropin Î² and aberrant results on computed tomography (CT) scans. The patient subsequently received conservative management to prevent renal damage, and a standard etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide and vincristine chemotherapy regimen for GTN was administered. Following eight cycles of chemotherapy, a follow-up CT examination indicated that the damage in the patient's left kidney could not be corrected with conservative treatments, therefore the left kidney was excised and a laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed. The pathological results were consistent with the clinical diagnosis and allowed further classification of the primary tumor as an IM. The present case demonstrated that it is possible for IM to metastasize to the kidney, and furthermore, that this type of metastatic tumor may be fragile and possess the potential to cause spontaneous kidney rupture.Severe ocular surface disease can result in limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), a condition leading to decreased visual acuity, photophobia, and ocular pain. To restore the ocular surface in advanced stem cell deficient corneas, an autologous or allogenic limbal stem cell transplantation is performed. In recent years, the risk of secondary LSCD due to removal of large limbal grafts has been significantly reduced by the optimization of cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET). Despite the great successes of CLET, there still is room for improvement as overall success rate is 70% and visual acuity often remains suboptimal after successful transplantation. Simple limbal epithelial transplantation reports higher success rates but has not been performed in as many patients yet. This review focuses on limbal epithelial stem cells and the pathophysiology of LSCD. State-of-the-art therapeutic management of LSCD is described, and new and evolving techniques in ocular surface regeneration are being discussed, in particular, advantages and disadvantages of alternative cell scaffolds and cell sources for cell based ocular surface reconstruction.Background. Murphy's sign and Charcot's triad are established clinical findings of acute cholecystitis and cholangitis, respectively, but both show low sensitivity and limited clinical application. We evaluated if indirect fist percussion of the liver improves the efficiency of diagnosing cholecystitis and cholangitis when used as a diagnostic adjunct. Methods. The presence/absence of right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness, Murphy's sign, and pain induced by indirect fist percussion of the liver was assessed, and the results were compared with the definite diagnosis based on ultrasound and additional examinations in patients aged over 18 who visited our outpatient clinic with suspected hepatobiliary diseases. Results. Four hundred and eight patients were investigated, and 40 had hepatobiliary infection (acute cholecystitis: 10, acute cholangitis: 28, liver abscess: 1, and hepatic cyst infection: 1). The sensitivity of indirect fist percussion of the liver for diagnosing hepatobiliary infection was 60%, being significantly higher than that of RUQ tenderness (33%) and Murphy's sign (30%), and its specificity was 85%. There was no significant improvement in sensitivity or diagnostic accuracy when Murphy's sign was combined with indirect fist percussion of the liver. Conclusion. Indirect fist percussion-induced liver pain is a useful clinical finding to diagnose hepatobiliary infection, with high-level sensitivity.Objectives. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tadalafil and Tamsulosin in treating Double J stent related symptoms. Methods. In a prospective study, 161 patients with DJ related symptoms were randomized into 3 groups: Group A patients (54), Group B patients (53), and Group C patients (54). They were given Tadalafil, Tamsulosin, and placebo, respectively, at 1st week till removal of DJ stent at 3rd week. All patients completed Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ) at 1st week and at 3rd week. The statistical significant difference among groups was determined by the t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test and multivariate analysis were used to assess association of the variables within the three groups, and the level of significance was set at P < 0.05. Results. Tadalafil and Tamsulosin were comparable in relieving urinary symptoms, general health, and work performance (OR = 0.65, 1.8, and 0.92). But Tadalafil was more effective in relieving body pain, sexual problems, and additional problems than Tamsulosin (OR = 5.95, 19.25, and 2.69) and was statistically significant as P < 0.05. Conclusion. Tadalafil was as effective as Tamsulosin in relieving urinary symptom but more effective in relieving sexual symptoms and body pain.BACKGROUND: Frailty is a new prognostic factor in cardiovascular medicine due to the aging and increasingly complex nature of elderly patients. It is useful and meaningful to prospectively analyze the manner in which frailty predicts short-term outcomes for elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: Patients aged â¥ 65 years, with diagnosis of ACS from cardiology department and geriatrics department were included from single-center. Clinical data including geriatrics syndromes were collected using Comprehensive Geriatrics Assessment. Frailty was defined according to the Clinical Frailty Scale and the impact of the co-morbidities on risk was quantified by the coronary artery disease (CAD)-specific index. Patients were followed up by clinical visit or telephone consultation and the median follow-up time is 120 days. Following-up items included all-cause mortality, unscheduled return visit, in-hospital and recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events. Multivariable regression survival analysis was performed using Cox regression. RESULTS: Of the 352 patients, 152 (43.18%) were considered frail according to the study instrument (5-7 on the scale), and 93 (26.42%) were considered moderately or severely frail (6-7 on the scale). Geriatrics syndromes including incontinence, fall history, visual impairment, hearing impairment, constipation, chronic pain, sleeping disorder, dental problems, anxiety or depression, and delirium were more frequently in frail patients than in non-frail patients (P = 0.000, 0.031, 0.009, 0.014, 0.000, 0.003, 0.022, 0.000, 0.074, and 0.432, respectively). Adjusted for sex, age, severity of coronary artery diseases (left main coronary artery lesion or not) and co-morbidities (CAD specific index) by Cox survival analysis, frailty was found to be strongly and independently associated with risk for the primary composite outcomes: all-cause mortality [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 5.393; 95% CI: 1.477-19.692, P = 0.011] and unscheduled return visit (HR = 2.832; 95% CI: 1.140-7.037, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive Geriatrics Assessment and Clinical Frail Scale were useful in evaluation of elderly patients with ACS. Frailty was strongly and independently associated with short-term outcomes for elderly patients with ACS.There is ample evidence that dementia changes the processing of pain. However, it is not known whether this change in pain processing is related to the general decline in cognitive functioning or whether it may be related to specific domains of cognitive functioning. With the present study we tried to answer this question. We assessed different cognitive domains (orientation, memory, abstract thinking/executive function, aphasia and apraxia, and information processing speed) in 70 older patients with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment up to moderate degrees of dementia). Pain responsiveness was assessed by measuring the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) threshold and facial responses to noxious electrical stimulation. Using regression analyses, we assessed which domain of cognitive functioning best predicted variance in pain responsiveness. Variance in pain responsiveness (NFR and facial expressions) was best explained by those items assessing executive functioning even when controlling for overall cognitive performance and memory functioning. The close association between executive functioning and pain responsiveness suggests that dementia-related neurodegeneration in prefrontal areas might result not only in reduced executive functioning but also in a loss of pain inhibitory potency, rendering the patient more vulnerable to pain. Our findings also suggest that pain assessment in dementia should be regularly completed by tests of cognitive functions.BACKGROUND: The oesophageal leak pressure is defined as the pressure which breaks the seal between the cuff of a supraglottic airway and the peri-cuff mucosa, allowing penetration of fluid into the pharynx and the oral cavity. As a consequence, a decrease in this variable increases the risk of reflux and can lead to pulmonary aspiration. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of cuff overinflation and pressure on the neck on the oesophageal leak pressure of seven supraglottic airways. METHODS: Three laryngeal masks, two laryngeal tubes, and two oesophageal-tracheal tubes were tested in an experimental setting. In five human cadavers, we simulated a sudden increase in oesophageal pressure. To measure baseline values (control), we used an intracuff pressure as recommended by the manufacturer. The first intervention included overinflation of the cuff by applying twice the amount of pressure recommended. A second intervention was defined as external pressure on the neck. RESULTS: The oesophageal leak pressure was decreased for laryngeal masks (control, 28 cm H2O; overinflation, 9 cm H2O; pressure on the neck, 8 cm H2O; P<0.01) and for laryngeal tubes (control, 68 cm H2O; overinflation, 37 cm H2O; pressure on the neck, 39 cm H2O; P<0.01) and was unaffected for oesophageal-tracheal tubes (control, 126 cm H2O; overinflation/pressure on the neck, 130 cm H2O; n.s.). CONCLUSION: Cuff overinflation and pressure on the neck can enhance the risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux when using supraglottic airways. Therefore, both manoeuvres should be avoided in clinical practice.BACKGROUND: It is well known that thermal softening of polyvinyl chloride tracheal tubes reduces nasal damage during nasotracheal intubation. We hypothesized that thermal softening of double-lumen endobronchial tubes (DLTs) may be effective for reducing airway injury. This randomized double-blind study was performed to investigate whether thermal softening of DLTs decreased postoperative sore throat, hoarseness or vocal cord injuries. METHODS: Patients (n=140) undergoing one lung anaesthesia were randomized into two groups (n=70 each) depending on whether the DLT was softened by warming or not before tracheal intubation. The DLTs were placed in warm saline [40(1)Â°C] in the thermal softening group or in room temperature saline in the control group for 10 min. The vocal cords were examined by using flexible laryngoscopy immediately after extubation. Sore throat and hoarseness were evaluated for three postoperative days. The primary outcomes were the incidence of sore throat, hoarseness, and vocal cord injuries. RESULTS: Sore throat and vocal cord injuries occurred less frequently in the thermal softening group than in the control group [14/70 vs 27/70, risk ratio (95% CI): 0.52 (0.30-0.90), P=0.025 for sore throat; 15/70 vs 27/70, risk ratio (95% CI): 0.56 (0.32-0.95), P=0.042 for vocal cord injuries]. However, the incidence of hoarseness was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Tracheal intubation with DLTs softened by warming decreased the postoperative incidence of sore throat and vocal cord injuries. Therefore, thermal softening of DLTs before intubation seems to be helpful in reducing airway injuries associated with DLT intubation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 01626365.BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of the dexketoprofen/tramadol 25 mg/75 mg fixed-dose combination vs dexketoprofen (25 mg) and tramadol (100 mg) in moderate-to-severe acute pain after total hip arthroplasty. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in patients experiencing pain of at least moderate intensity on the day after surgery, compared with placebo at first administration to validate the pain model. The study drug was administered orally every 8 h throughout a 5 day period. Rescue medication, metamizole 500 mg, was available during the treatment period. The evaluation of efficacy was based on patient assessments of pain intensity and pain relief. The primary end point was the mean sum of the pain intensity difference values throughout the first 8 h (SPID8). RESULTS: Overall, 641 patients, mean age 62 (range 29-80) yr, were analysed; mean (sd) values of SPID8 were 247 (157) for dexketoprofen/tramadol, 209 (155) for dexketoprofen, 205 (146) for tramadol, and 151 (159) for placebo. The primary analysis confirmed the superiority of the combination over dexketoprofen 25 mg (P=0.019; 95% confidence interval 6.4-73) and tramadol 100 mg (P=0.012; 95% confidence interval 9.5-76). The single components were superior to placebo (P<0.05), confirming model sensitivity. Most secondary analyses supported the superiority of the combination. The incidence of adverse drug reactions was low and similar among active treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The efficacy results confirmed the superiority of dexketoprofen/tramadol over its single components, even at higher doses (tramadol), with a safety profile fully in line with that previously known for these agents in monotherapy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2012-004548-31 (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=eudract_number:201 2-004548-31);ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01902134 (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01902134?term=NCT01902134&rank=1).BACKGROUND: Axillary vein catheterization via a distal approach is an alternative to the proximal approach to axillary/subclavian vein catheterization under ultrasound (US) guidance. The aim of this trial was to compare the two approaches. METHODS: In a randomized single-centre study, all patients requiring central vein catheterization in intensive care or the operating room were randomly assigned to proximal or distal approach groups. If catheterization failed after two attempts using the approach allocated, the non-allocated approach was used. The primary endpoint was the initial success rate of distal to compared with the proximal approach, using a non-inferiority analysis (lower limit 90% CI greater than -8% non-inferiority margin for group difference). The secondary endpoints were: overall success rates, catheter position and complications. RESULTS: 119/122 included patients were analysed (57 and 62 in the proximal and distal axillary approach groups, respectively). Primary success rates for proximal and distal sites were 87.7 and 85.5%, respectively (difference -2.2%, 90% CI [-12.5-8.1%], non-inferiority P=0.18). The proximal and distal overall success rates were 96.5 and 98.4%, respectively (difference -1.9%, 90% CI [-4.9-8.7%], non-inferiority P<0.01). Thrombogenic catheter positions were 7 (12.3%) in proximal approach group vs 19 (31.7%) in the distal approach group (P=0.01). Complications were comparable in the two groups (2 (3.3%) vs 4 (6.5%), P=0.68). CONCLUSION: In terms of absolute and overall success rates, a distal approach is not non-inferior to a proximal approach. Although associated with a more thrombogenic catheter extremity position, the distal approach can be considered as a rescue alternative after failure of a proximal approach. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01543360.Cervical epidural analgesia (CEA) is an analgesic technique, potentially useful for surgeries involving the upper body. Despite the inherent technical risks and systemic changes, it has been used for various surgeries. There have been no previously published systematic reviews aimed at assessing its clinical utility. This systematic review was performed to explore the perioperative benefits of CEA. The review was also aimed at identifying the rationale of its use, reported surgical indications and the method of use. We performed a literature search involving PubMed and Embase databases, to identify studies using CEA for surgical indications. Out of 467 potentially relevant articles, 73 articles were selected. Two independent investigators extracted data involving 5 randomized controlled trials, 17 observational comparative trials, and 51 case reports (series). The outcomes studied in most comparative studies were on effects of local anaesthetics and other agents, systemic effects, and feasibility of CEA. In one randomized controlled study, CEA was observed to decrease the resting pain scores after pharyngo-laryngeal surgeries. In a retrospective study, CEA was shown to decrease the cancer recurrence after pharyngeal-hypopharyngeal surgeries. The limited evidence, small studies, and the chosen outcomes do not allow for any specific recommendations based on the relative benefit or harm of CEA. Considering the potential for significant harm, in the face of better alternatives, its use must have a strong rationale mostly supported by unique patient and surgical demands. Future studies must aim to assess analgesic comparator effectiveness for clinically relevant outcomes.BACKGROUND: This systematic review evaluated the evidence comparing patient-important outcomes in spinal or epidural vs general anaesthesia for total hip and total knee arthroplasty. METHODS: MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, Thomson Reuters Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until March 2015 were searched. Eligible randomized controlled trials or prospective comparative studies investigating mortality, major morbidity, and patient-experience outcomes directly comparing neuraxial (spinal or epidural) with general anaesthesia for total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, or both were included. Independent reviewers working in duplicate extracted study characteristics, validity, and outcomes data. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effects model. RESULTS: We included 29 studies involving 10 488 patients. Compared with general anaesthesia, neuraxial anaesthesia significantly reduced length of stay (weighted mean difference -0.40 days; 95% confidence interval -0.76 to -0.03; P=0.03; I2 73%; 12 studies). No statistically significant differences were found between neuraxial and general anaesthesia for mortality, surgical duration, surgical site or chest infections, nerve palsies, postoperative nausea and vomiting, or thromboembolic disease when antithrombotic prophylaxis was used. Subgroup analyses failed to find statistically significant interactions (P>0.05) based on risk of bias, type of surgery, or type of neuraxial anaesthesia. CONCLUSION: Neuraxial anaesthesia for total hip or total knee arthroplasty, or both appears equally effective without increased morbidity when compared with general anaesthesia. There is limited quantitative evidence to suggest that neuraxial anaesthesia is associated with improved perioperative outcomes. Future investigations should compare intermediate and long-term outcome differences to better inform anaesthesiologists, surgeons, and patients on importance of anaesthetic selection.PMID: 26787786  [PubMed - in process]PMID: 26787785  [PubMed - in process]PMID: 26787783  [PubMed - in process]BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nephrolithiasis is a prevalent condition that affects 10%-15% of adults in their lifetime. It is associated with high morbidity due to colicky pain, the necessity for surgical intervention, and sometimes progression to CKD. In recent years, multiple monogenic causes of nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis have been identified. However, the prevalence of each monogenic gene in a pediatric renal stone cohort has not yet been extensively studied. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To determine the percentage of cases that can be explained molecularly by mutations in one of 30 known nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis genes, we conducted a high-throughput exon sequencing analysis in an international cohort of 143 individuals <18Â years of age, with nephrolithiasis (n=123) or isolated nephrocalcinosis (n=20). Over 7Â months, all eligible individuals at three renal stone clinics in the United States and Europe were approached for study participation. RESULTS: We detected likely causative mutations in 14 of 30 analyzed genes, leading to a molecular diagnosis in 16.8% (24 of 143) of affected individuals; 12 of the 27 detected mutations were not previously described as disease causing (44.4%). We observed that in our cohort all individuals with infantile manifestation of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis had causative mutations in recessive rather than dominant monogenic genes. In individuals who manifested later in life, causative mutations in dominant genes were more frequent. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first exclusively pediatric cohort examined for monogenic causes of nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis, and suggest that important therapeutic and preventative measures may result from mutational analysis in individuals with early manifestation of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis.Chronic pain is a multi-faceted and complex condition. Broadly classified into somatic, visceral or neuropathic pain, it is poorly managed despite its prevalence. Current drugs used for the treatment of chronic pain are limited by tolerance with long-term use, abuse potential, and multiple adverse side effects. The persistent nature of pain suggests that epigenetic machinery may be a critical factor driving chronic pain. In this review we discuss the latest insights into epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and miRNAs, and describe their involvement in the pathophysiology of chronic pain and whether epigenetic modifications could be applied as future therapeutic targets for chronic pain. We provide evidence from experimental models and translational research in human tissue that have enhanced our understanding of epigenetic processes mediating nociception and then speculate on the potential future use of more specific and selective agents that target epigenetic mechanisms to attenuate pain.This study examines the effects of electroacupuncture treatment on health-related quality of life and heart rate variability in women with fibromyalgia. Twenty women with fibromyalgia received a 10-week treatment with electroacupuncture. Primary outcome measures were the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire, and heart rate variability. Compared with pretreatment, there was a significant improvement in health-related quality of life; electroacupuncture significantly increases low frequency, low frequency/high frequency, and decreases high frequency, all indicating rise in sympathetic tone. Fibromyalgia patients showed a significant (P < .05) improvement in pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores; and physical function, physical role, body pain, general health, and vitality scores on the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire. These changes mainly in mental status scores could be related to a new autonomic balance with sympathetic predominance at the horary of the study.AIM: Oral medication is of paramount importance for pain treatment. Analgesics, antiulcer (AUDs) and antithrombotic drugs (ATDs) are often coprescribed in elderly people. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) require AUDs to lower the risk of peptic ulcer, and potentially interfere with ATDs. The aim of this study was to quantify the prevalence of NSAID use in patients with gastrointestinal, cardiac or kidney damage in the year 2013, compared to the general population. METHODS: We performed a population-based case-control study in the Republic of San Marino to evaluate the Odds-Ratios for upper gastrointestinal damage (gastroduodenal ulcers and/or erosions, GUE), ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), and renal function impairment (assessed using the CKD-EPI formula), in people who had taken AUDs, ATDs, or NSAIDs in the previous 90 days, versus people who had not taken such drugs in the same period of time. RESULTS: We found that AUDs decreased the OR for GUE (OR: 0.762; CI:0.598-0.972), while ATDs and NSAIDs increased the risk (OR: 1.238 and CI: 0.935-1.683; OR:1.203 and CI:0.909-1.592, respectively). NSAIDs seemed to increase the risk of IHD, although this was not statistically significant (OR=1.464; CI=0.592-3.621). AUDs and ATDs significantly increased the risk of renal function impairment (OR=1.369 and CI=1.187-1.579; OR=1.818 and CI=1.578-2.095, respectively), while this effect was not observed for NSAIDs. CONCLUSION: NSAIDs may induce gastrointestinal and cardiovascular damage, not only by themselves, but also when used concomitantly with common medications such as AUDs or ATDs, due to additive and/or synergistic effects. We performed a "pragmatic" analysis of the association of organ damage with use of NSAIDs/AUDs/ATDs, including patient age, treatment duration and dose, to allow for an immediate application of our findings to everyday clinical practice.AIM: To investigate the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) after discharge from the emergency department (ED) with unspecified chest pain and the predictive value of cardiovascular risk factors included in HEART score. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a register-based retrospective cohort study including all patients discharged with the diagnosis 'unspecified chest pain' from Swedish EDs between 2006-2013. Diagnosis and drug prescriptions were collected from national registers and the association to the occurrence of MACE was studied with logistic regression and category-free net reclassification improvement (cNRI). Out of 74,329 included patients 619 (0.8%) experienced MACE within 30 days of discharge from the ED. Hypertension (odds ratio (OR) 4.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.02-5.59), diabetes mellitus (3.76, 3.10-4.57), hyperlipidaemia (1.92, 1.51-2.44), and earlier cardiovascular disease (CVD) were all associated with MACE. The addition of hypertension to a risk factor model improved net reclassification (cNRI 53%, 95% CI 29-67%). The variables age (A) (1 point OR 7.01, 95% CI 4.79-10.26, 2 points OR 23.57, 95% CI 16.35-33.97) and risk factors (R) (1 point OR 3.76, 95% CI 3.05-4.63, 2 points OR 10.94, 95% CI 8.96-13.38) in HEART score were both independently associated with MACE with a combination area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: MACE after discharge with unspecified chest pain is uncommon and associated with a diagnosis of hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors. Our findings support the use of risk factors in HEART score. The relation between age and MACE was not linear and our data indicates that the lower cut-off value for age in HEART score should be adjusted downwards.AIM: Novel minimally invasive techniques aimed to reposition the haemorrhoidal zone have been established for prolapsing haemorrhoids. We present a prospective randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of additional Doppler-guided ligation of submucosal haemorrhoidal arteries in patients with symptomatic grade III haemorrhoids. The trial was registered as ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT02372981. METHOD: All consecutive patients with symptomatic grade III haemorrhoids were randomly allocated to one of the two study arms: (Group A) DG-HAL with mucopexy or (Group B) mucopexy alone. End points were postoperative pain, faecal incontinence, bleeding, residual prolapse and alterations of vascularisation of the anorectal vascular plexus. Vascularisation of the anorectal vascular plexus was assessed by transperineal contrast enhanced ultrasound. Patients recorded their symptoms in a diary maintained for a month. RESULTS: Forty patients were recruited and randomised to the two study groups. Patients in Group A had less pain in the first two postoperative weeks. At the 12-month follow-up, two patients in Group A (10%) and one in Group B (5%) showed recurrent grade III haemorrhoids (p=0.274). No significant morphological changes were observed in the transperineal ultrasound findings between the preoperative assessment and the assessment at 1 and 6-months in either group (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Mucopexy techniques for treating prolapsing haemorrhoids are effective, but Doppler-guided HAL does not add significantly to the results achieved by mucopexy Repositioning the haemorrhoidal zone is the key to success, and mucopexy should be placed at the sites of the largest visible prolapse.

METHODS: Our study cohort consisted of 17,169 Finnish twins born before 1958. Data on BMI and multiple covariates from questionnaires in 1975 and 1981 were included and DPs were collected from the national pension registers until the end of 2004. Cox proportional hazards regression models with Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: General DP was granted to 2853 individuals and DP due to MSD to 1143 individuals during the 23-year follow-up. A one-unit increase in BMI in both 1975 (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05, 1.10) and 1981 (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04, 1.07), as well as the stability of and change in BMI from 1975 to 1981 were all associated with an increased risk of DP. These associations held in the analyses controlling for multiple covariates (age, sex, socioeconomic status, education, marital status, leisure-time physical activity, and musculoskeletal pain), and mainly also familial confounding, that is, genetics and shared environment. HR for stable obesity was 2.28 (95% CI 1.69, 3.08) for DP due to MSD, and 1.91 (95% CI 1.56, 2.34) for general DP in the fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: BMI is an early predictor of general DP and also of DP due to MSD. Owing to the independency of various covariates and potentially also familial confounding, BMI may possibly have a direct effect on the risk of DP.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Carpal fusions are useful for treating specific carpal disorders, maximizing postoperative wrist motion, hand strength, reducing pain and instability of the joint. The surgeon selects the appropriate treatment by considering the degree of stability, the chronicity of the injury, functional demands of the patient and former patient's outcomes as well. However there are not many studies regarding the load distribution provided by the treatment. So, the purpose of this study is to analyze the load distribution through the wrist joint with an arthrodesis treatment and compare the results with a normal wrist. METHOD: To this end the rigid body spring model (RBSM) method was used on a three-dimensional model of the wrist joint. The cartilage and ligaments were simulated as springs acting under compression and tension, respectively, while the bones were considered as rigid bodies. To simulate the arthrodesis, the fused bones were considered as a single rigid body. RESULTS: The changes on the load distribution for each arthrodesis agree with the treatment objective, reducing load transmission through a specific articular surface. For example, for SLAC/SNAC II most of the treatments reduced the load transmitted through the radioscaphoid fossae, almost by 8%. However, the capitolunate (CL) arthrodesis was the treatment that managed to keep the load transmitted through the radiolunate joint closer to normal conditions. Also, in treatments where the scaphoid was excised (3-corner, 4-corner and capitolunate arthrodesis), the joint surface between the lunate surface compensates by doubling the transmitted force to the radius. CONCLUSIONS: The common arthrodesis for treating SLAC/SNAC II-III, reduces, in fact, the load on the radioscaphoid joint. Alternative treatments that reduce load distribution on the radiocarpal joint should be three corner and capitolunate arthrodesis for treating SLAC/SNAC-II; and for SLAC/SNAC-III four corners with scaphoid excision. On Kienbock's disease. Scaphocapitate (SC) arthrodesis is more effective on reducing the load transmission through the radiolunate and ulnolunate joints. All arthrodesis treatment should consider changes on the load transmission, and also bones' fusion rates and pain reduction on patient's outcomes.BACKGROUND: It is well recognised that low back pain is a significant public health problem and engagement in moderate levels of physical activity is associated with positive outcomes. Conservative active care, such as exercise, is effective in reducing pain and disability associated with chronic low back pain. However, a rapid decline in clinical outcomes is commonly seen after discharge from treatment. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of a mobile health supported physical activity intervention (compared to standard care) in care-seeking, pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain after discharge from treatment. We will recruit 68 patients with chronic low back pain following discharge from an outpatient hospital program, who will be randomly allocated to the physical activity intervention (nâ=â34) or the standard care group (nâ=â34) and monitored for 6Â months. The physical activity intervention will involve a physical activity advice booklet, a face-to-face health coaching session and 12 fortnightly follow-up telephone-based health coaching sessions. This intervention will be supported by provision of a specifically designed web app and a physical activity monitoring device (FitBit). The standard care group will receive the physical activity advice booklet only. DISCUSSION: This pilot trial will investigate a new model to prevent clinical decline in people following conservative treatment for chronic low back pain. If proven to be effective, this approach will constitute a major advance in the management of low back pain. Chronic patients who experience recurrent pain and disability after treatment are prone to seek additional care in the form of physiotherapy, medication, emergency department attendance, specialist consultation or spinal surgery. This model aims to maintain functional levels and reduce care-seeking empowering patients to self-manage their low back pain by offering them a contemporary patient-centred physical activity program with the support of mobile health technology. The outcomes of this trial will have immediate implications for clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12615000189527 (26-02-2015).Inflammation of the colon in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) causes pain and altered motility, at least in part through the damage of the myenteric neurons (MNs). Thus, it is important to evaluate new drugs for UC treatment that could also protect myenteric neurons efficiently. As a well-known neural protective and anti-inflammatory agent, melatonin could protect neurons from damage through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and antioxidant responsive element (Nrf2-ARE) signaling pathway. Therefore, we investigated the potential protective effect of melatonin against MN damage during colitis induced by 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) in rats. Colitis was induced by intracolonic (i.c.) instillation of DNBS, and treated with melatonin at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg for four days. The damage of MN in the left colon was immunohistochemically evaluated in different groups. Ulcerations and inflammation in the colon were semiquantitatively observed. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were detected to evaluate the inflammatory and oxidative stress status. The protein and mRNA expression of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the colon were detected by Western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) respectively. Melatonin partially prevented the loss of MN and alleviated the inflammation and oxidative stress induced by DNBS. In addition, melatonin markedly increased the Nrf2 and HO-1 level in the colitis. These results indicate that melatonin protects MN from damage by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, effects that are partly mediated by the Nrf2-ARE pathway.

METHODS: We evaluated 12 patients with a history of BPI with persistent shoulder paralysis. All patients had compromised ipsilateral lower trapezius muscle function. All patients underwent CLTOT prolonged with lumbar fascia to the affected infraspinatus tendon either isolated (7Â patients) or as part of multiple tendon transfer (5 patients). Standardized patient outcomes measures were obtained. RESULTS: At 23 months' follow-up, 10 patients had improved shoulder external rotation from no motion preoperatively to an average external rotation 110Â° from the abdomen. Five patients had marked improvement of pain, including 2 with isolated CLTOT and 3 with additional tendon transfers. Two patients experienced no change in pain. There were noted improvements in the Constant shoulder scores, simple shoulder value, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores. One patient sustained a fall resulting in stretch injury to the transfer, underwent successful revision surgery, and regained 100Â° active shoulder external rotation away from the abdomen more than a year after revision surgery. Another patient's transfer failed during rehabilitation but the patient elected not to pursue treatment. No patients had changes in contralateral shoulder motion or strength or any pain from the contralateral shoulder. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that CLTOT to the infraspinatus tendon was effective in improving shoulder external rotation in patients with BPI. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.Background/Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for the treatment of symptomatic pancreas divisum (PD) and to discuss whether ERCP procedures and outcomes in younger patients differ from those of adults. Methods: Symptomatic patients with PD were included in the study and divided into underaged (age â¤17 years) and adult (age â¥18 years) group. The clinical information of each patient was reviewed, and then the patients were contacted by telephone or their medical records were reviewed to determine their long-term followup outcomes. Results: A total of 141 procedures were performed in 82 patients (17 underaged and 65 adult patients). The ERCP indications included abdominal pain (39.02%), pancreatitis (12.20%), recurrent pancreatitis (36.59%), and other discomfort (12.20%). The endoscopic interventions included endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy in 44.68% of the patients, bouginage in 26.95%, pancreatic ductal stone extraction in 19.15%, endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage in 21.99%, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatic drainage in 56.74%. After a median follow-up of 41 months, the overall response rate was 62.32%. Between the underaged group and the adult group, significant differences were not observed in the ERCP procedures, complications and longterm follow-up results. Conclusions: ERCP is a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic PD. Based on the details, complications, and follow-up results, the ERCP procedure did not present differences between the underaged and adult groups.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using the zygomatic buttress as an intraoral bone harvesting donor site and determine the safety of this harvesting procedure for later optimal positioning of dental implants in accordance with prosthodontic and functional principles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A consecutive retrospective study was conducted on patients who had been treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Ulm military and academic hospital, over a 3-year period (January 2008 to December 2010). Medical history, smoking status, area of surgery, and complications were recorded. The need for bone grafting was defined by the impossibility of installing implants of adequate length or diameter to fulfill prosthetic requirements, or for esthetic reasons. The patients were treated using a 2-stage technique. During the first operation, bone blocks harvested from the zygomatic buttress region were placed as lateral onlay grafts and fixed with titanium osteosynthesis screws after exposure of the deficient alveolar ridge. After 3-6 months of healing, the flap was reopened, the screws removed and the implants placed. RESULTS: A total of 113 zygomatic buttress bone block grafts in 112 patients were performed. Graft loss and graft removal were defined as failure; swelling, wound dehiscence, infection with pus, temporary paresthesia, and perforations of the maxillary sinus membrane were defined as complications. According to our criteria, 4 (3.5%) of the patients presented postoperative complications of the donor site and 20 (17.8%) of the recipient site. Throughout, 93 (82.3%) of the bone grafts were successful and 20 (17.6%) had complications, regardless of the final success of the implant procedure. Smoking was associated with a high rate of complications and graft failure. Early graft exposure appeared to compromise the results, whereas pain and swelling were comparable to usual dentoalveolar procedures. However, in 1.7% of all cases, concerning 2 patients, the final rehabilitation with dental implants was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: The zygomatic buttress block bone graft is a safe intraoral donor site for the reconstruction of small- to medium-sized alveolar defects, providing the greatest surgical access with minimal postoperative complications.INTRODUCTION: Pelvic fixation via iliac screws is a crucial technique in stabilizing metastatic lumbosacral deformity. MIS iliac screw fixation avoids complications of an open approach and is a viable palliative option in treating patients with painful instability and advanced disease, unsuited for major reconstruction. In this paper we describe the use of MIS iliac screw fixation in treatment of painful metastatic LSJ deformity, highlighting our treatment rationale, selection criteria, technical experience and outcomes. METHODS: Five patients with lumbosacral metastatic deformity who underwent MIS lumbopelvic stabilization using iliac screws were prospectively studied. Patients had severe axial back pain in erect posture with significant resolution when supine. All patients had advanced disease with unfavorable tumor scores for major spinal reconstruction. RESULTS: Mean cohort age was 62Â years. Median pre-op SIN and Tokuhashi scores were 13 and 9, respectively. All patients were instrumented successfully without conversion to open technique. Mean preoperative and postoperative Cobb angle was 11Â° and 5.4Â°, respectively. There were no neurological deficits or wound complications postop. Postoperative CT scans showed no iliac screw and sacroiliac joint bony violation. Mean time for commencement of adjuvant therapy was 2.8Â weeks. Average follow-up was 13.2Â months. No screw breakage, wound complication, symptomatic implant prominence and SI joint pain were noted at last follow-up. CONCLUSION: MIS iliac screw fixation is feasible, reproducible and can be employed without complications in metastatic spine. This opens a new avenue of surgical management for metastatic lumbosacral disease patients, who otherwise may be inoperable and provide better soft tissue control and earlier postoperative adjuvant treatment opportunity.PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of continuous epidural infusion analgesia (ED) with 0.2Â % Ropivacaine versus IV PCA (Fentanyl) in spinal fusion surgery patients. METHOD: A prospective randomized comparative clinical trial. Patients were randomized into one of two groups-the epidural group (ED-51 patients) and the IV PCA group (IV-43 patients). The epidural catheter tip was placed one level cephalad to the level of the PLIF in patients in the ED group. Patients were assessed by determining the pain score, cumulative opioid requirement, adverse effects, and satisfaction. RESULTS: Pain score comparisons between the ED group and the IV group, respectively, were as follows: immediate postoperative status: 2.1Â Â±Â 1.5 vs. 7.2Â Â±Â 2.1, pÂ =Â 0.01; postoperative day 1: 2.3Â Â±Â 1.9 vs. 6.8Â Â±Â 2.3, pÂ =Â 0.02; postoperative day 2: 1.9Â Â±Â 1.8 vs. 5.4Â Â±Â 2.1, pÂ =Â 0.02; postoperative day 3: 1.5Â Â±Â 1.6 vs. 3.9Â Â±Â 1.9, pÂ =Â 0.03; postoperative day 4: 3.8Â Â±Â 2.1 vs. 3.1Â Â±Â 1.9, pÂ =Â 0.4. Lower levels of opioids were required in the ED group, and fewer opioid-related complications developed in the patients in this group. Complications related to the use of epidural catheters were comparable between the two groups. Patient satisfaction with postoperative pain control was higher in the ED group. CONCLUSION: In comparison with the use of IV PCA only, continuous epidural infusion of Ropivacaine resulted in lower pain scores and opioid consumption and higher patient satisfaction levels after posterior lumbar interbody fusion.PMID: 26787332  [PubMed - in process]BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in end-of-life care due to their proximity to the patient's dwelling-place and their contact to relatives and other care providers. METHODS: In order to get a better understanding of the role which the GP sees him- or herself as playing in end-of-life care and which care their dying patients get, we conducted this written survey. It asked questions about the most recently deceased patient of each physician. The questionnaire was sent to 1,201 GPs in southern North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) and the Canton of Bern (Switzerland). RESULTS: Response rate was 27.5Â % (nâ=â330). The average age of responding physicians was 54.5Â years (range: 34-76; standard derivation: 7.4), 68Â % of them were male and 45Â % worked alone in their practice. Primary outcome measures of this observational study are the characteristics of recently deceased patients as well as their care and the involvement of other professional caregivers. Almost half of the most recently deceased patients had cancer. Only 3 to 16Â % of all deceased suffered from severe levels of pain, nausea, dyspnea or emesis. More than 80Â % of the doctors considered themselves to be an indispensable part of their patient's end-of-life care. Almost 90Â % of the doctors were in contact with the patient's family and 50Â % with the responsible nursing service. The majority of the GPs had taken over the coordination of care and cooperation with other attending physicians. CONCLUSION: The study confirms the relevance of caring for dying patients in GPs work and provides an important insight into their perception of their own role.INTRODUCTION: Internal herniation (IH) probably is the most elusive complication of laparoscopic Roux- en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery. This study provides a definition for IH, a diagnosing algorithm, and information on several factors influencing IH formation. METHOD: Baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, imaging studies, operative findings, and follow up data of 1583 patients that underwent LRYGB at our bariatric facility between 2007 and 2013 were recorded. Follow up varied between 3 and 76Â months, and 85Â % of the data was available for analysis at 12Â months. Our surgical technique was standardized. Intermesenteric spaces were not closed until July 2012, where after they were closed. To facilitate comparison, IH cases were matched with controls. RESULTS: Forty patients (2.5Â %) had an IH during re-laparoscopy. The modal clinical presentation is acute onset epigastric discomfort, often crampy/colicky in nature. Additional examinations included laboratory testing, abdominal X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal CT scanning. Patients who developed an IH lost a significantly higher percentage of their total body weight than their matched controls at every time point. IH incidence was higher in the non-closure group than the closure group. CONCLUSION: The large variation in reported IH incidence is due to the large variation in IH definition. To gain more uniformity in reporting IH prevalence, we propose the use of the AMSTERDAM classification. Post-LRYGB patients with acute onset crampy/colicky epigastric pain should undergo abdominal ultrasound to rule out gallbladder pathology and offered re-laparoscopy with a low threshold. IH incidence is highest among patients with rapid weight loss and non-closure of intermesenteric defects.BACKGROUND: Trauma-related mortality can be lowered by efficient prehospital care. Less is known about whether gender influences the prehospital trauma care provided. The aim of this study was to explore gender-related differences in prehospital trauma care of severely injured trauma patients, with a special focus on triage, transportation, and interventions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study based on local trauma registries and hospital and ambulance records in Stockholm County, Sweden. A total of 383 trauma patients (279 males and 104 females)â>â15Â years of age with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ofâ>â15 transported to emergency care hospitals in the Stockholm area were included. RESULTS: Male patients had a 2.75 higher odds ratio (95Â % CI, 1.2-6.2) for receiving the highest prehospital priority compared to females on controlling for injury mechanism and vital signs on scene. No significant difference between genders was detected regarding other aspects of the prehospital care provided. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that prehospital prioritization among severely injured late adolescent and adult trauma patients differs between genders. Knowledge of a more diffuse presentation of symptoms in female trauma patients despite severe injury may help to adapt and improve prehospital trauma care for this group.PURPOSE OF STUDY Fractures of the distal radius and distal ulna require anatomical reconstruction for good restoration of wrist and hand function. In this study we compared the results of conservative treatment with those of plate osteosynthesis management in distal ulna fractures of patients who had concomitant fractures of the distal radius indicated for plate osteosynthesis. Our objective was to specify indications for plate osteosynthesis of a distal ulna fracture in the case of an associated distal radius fracture. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 27 patients were evaluated. In 17 of them, distal radius fractures were treated by plate osteosynthesis and distal ulna fractures conservatively (CONS group). In 12 patients, both distal radius and distal ulna fractures were treated by plate osteosynthesis (SURG group). Osteosynthesis was carried out using an APTUS variable-angle locking system (Medartis, Basel, Switzerland). In two SURG group patients with distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability, the radius and ulna in anatomical position were secured with two Kirschner wires. RESULTS Fracture union of the distal radius was achieved in all patients. Non-union of the distal ulna was recorded in one patient of each group. No secondary displacement of distal radius fragments during bone union was found in either group. Displacement of fragments during the healing of distal ulna fracture occurred in one (6.7%) patient of the CONS group. Out of the parameters evaluated, the restriction of motion below 80% of the original range in volar flexion, dorsal flection and supination was recorded in three CONS patients (20.0%) and two SURG patients (16.7%). No DRUJ instability was found. Intra-operative swelling preventing closure of surgical wounds was managed by secondary wound suture in one SURG patient (8.3%). There were no other complications. DISCUSSION Views vary on whether the distal ulna should be treated by plate osteosynthesis when, after distal radius fixation, its fracture managed by closed reduction heals well. A distal ulna plate often causes pain and has to be removed. The acute cases of DRUJ instability caused by comminuted distal ulna fracture can be treated by osteosynthesis of the distal ulna and two Kirschner wires inserted into the fracture site in an ulnar-to-radial direction. For chronic radioulnar instability, various methods involving free tendon grafts and dynamic tenodesis are used. Other options include the SauvÃ©-Kapandji procedure based on inducing artificial non-union of the distal ulna diaphysis and radioulnar arthrodesis; in our modification of this technique we use a single cancellous malleolar screw. In severely comminuted fractures of the distal ulna with injury to articular cartilage, ulnar head replacement can be indicated. CONCLUSIONS Distal ulna fractures can be treated conservatively if osteosynthesis of the distal radius in the anatomical position is achieved together with anatomical reduction of bone fragments of the distal ulna. When a distal radius fracture managed by osteosynthesis is not accompanied by anatomical reduction of distal ulna fragments, or the ulna is shorter or longer than the contralateral bone, an open reduction and stabilisation using an angle-stable locking plate, set at an adequate radius-toulna length ratio, is the method of choice.KEY WORDS: fracture, radius, ulna, plate osteosynthesis.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of the study was to measure the sensorimotor brain adaptation activity, shown on functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI), in relation to the degree and extent of spinal cord compression or cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) detected by cervical spine MRI. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-one patients (average age, 57 years; 9 men and 12 women) with anterior cervical cord compression detected on cervical MRI scans were included. On the images, the degree of spinal canal stenosis, the spinal cord compression based on the antero-posterior diameter of the spinal canal and on transverse areas of the cervical spinal cord and cervical spinal canal, and changes in spinal cord signal intensity were identified. Clinical examination included neurological status, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, Neck Disability Index (NDI) and pain intensity assessment using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Electrophysiological tests involving motor evoked and sensory evoked potential (MEP and SEP) recording were conducted and, using fMRI, brain activity during movement of both arms was measured. Based on the transverse spinal cord area of above or below 70 mm2, the patients were placed into two subgroups. According to changes in spinal cord signal intensity, the patients were included into three subgroups with normal findings, incipient myelopathy and advanced myelopathy, respectively. Surgery was carried out from the anterior approach and involved cervical disc replacement. All examinations were performed again at 6 months after surgery. Pre- and post-operative results were compared within each set of subgroups and statistically evaluated. RESULTS The average pre-operative values were found to increase post-operatively as follows: from 6.4 mm to 8.9 mm (by 39%) for the antero-posterior diameter of the spinal canal; from 129.3 mm2 to 162.8 mm2 (by 26%) for the transverse area of the spinal canal; from 72.6 mm2 to 87.4 mm2 (by 20%) for the transverse spinal cord area; and from 16.3 to 17.4 for the JOA score. The average NDI decreased from 37.9 to 23.7 and the average VAS fell from 6.4 to 1.5. All patients with the change of spinal cord signal that indicated advanced myelopathy also had relevant pathological findings on MEP/SEP examination and this was statistically significant. There was no significant difference in fMRI scans between the two subgroups established on the basis of transverse spinal cord area measurements. In the patients grouped by a change in spinal cord signals, the pre-operative fMRI showed a significantly higher brain activation volume in the subgroup with advanced myelopathy, as compared with the two other subgroups. Surgery resulted in a moderate reduction of the volume of active brain tissue in all three groups. In the patients with advanced myelopathy evaluated in relation to local changes in brain activation, surgery led to a significant decrease in activation volumes in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex and cerebellar hemisphere. There was also a significant increase in activation of the contralateral supplementary motor cortex. DISCUSSION It is evident that the brain responds to spinal cord damage by increased activity, but with a certain delay. A slightly altered spinal cord signal intensity, such as in incipient myelopathy, apparently does not result in brain activation. On the other hand, significant changes in signal intensity in advanced myelopathy are related to deterioration of spinal cord function, as shown by MEP and SEP examination results, and an increase in both the volume and intensity of cortical motor activation as a compensation mechanism for myelopathy. CONCLUSIONS Hyperintense spinal cord signals on T2-weighted images correlated with the pathological spinal cord function detected by electrophysiological test in all patients. The transverse spinal cord area (around 70 mm2) showed no significant correlation with either sensory and motor brain adaptations or the results of SEP and MEP testing; therefore, as a criterion for indication to surgery it is of no value. The patients with advanced myelopathy, as detected by spinal cord MRI, had a significantly higher pre-operative cortical motor activation on fMRI than patients with normal findings or those with incipient myelopathy. In addition, the patterns of cortical motor activation altered significantly at 6 months after spinal cord decompression, which was shown by an increase or decrease in activation of the relevant motor cortex areas.KEY WORDS: cervical spondylotic myelopathy, functional magnetic resonance imaging, surgical decompression, cortical reorganisation.We report the case of a French traveler who developed acute pulmonary schistosomiasis 2 months after visiting Benin. He presented with a 1-month history of fever, cough, and thoracic pain. Initial investigations revealed hypereosinophilia and multiple nodular lesions on chest computed tomography scan. Lung biopsies were performed 2 months later because of migrating chest infiltrates and increasing eosinophilia. Histological examination showed schistosomal egg-induced pulmonary granulomas with ova exhibiting a prominent terminal spine, resembling Schistosoma haematobium. However, egg shells were Ziehl-Neelsen positive, raising the possibility of a Schistosoma intercalatum or a Schistosoma guineensis infection. Moreover, involvement of highly infectious hybrid species cannot be excluded considering the atypical early pulmonary oviposition. This case is remarkable because of the rarity of pulmonary schistosomiasis, its peculiar clinical presentation and difficulties in making species identification. It also emphasizes the need to consider schistosomiasis diagnosis in all potentially exposed travelers with compatible symptoms.This n=40 cohort study on superficial and partial thickness burns compares novel keratin-based products with the standard products used at our facility. The keratin products are found to facilitate healing with minimal scarring, be well tolerated with minimal pain and itch, be easy to use for the health professional and be cost effective for the health care provider. For these reasons they are being adopted into use at our facility.OBJECTIVE: The study aims were to evaluate the effects of radial shock wave therapy (RSWT) in dogs with hip osteoarthritis (OA) using clinical assessment and kinetic analysis. METHODS: Thirty dogs diagnosed with bilateral hip OA and 30 healthy dogs were used. In OA dogs, one limb was randomly selected for treatment with RSWT while the contralateral limb served as an untreated control. Dogs were evaluated while walking on a pressure walkway. Peak vertical force (PVF) and vertical impulse (VI) were documented; symmetry index (SI) was also calculated. Blinded clinical evaluation was performed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Owner perception data regarding levels of physical activity were also collected. The RSWT protocol (2000 pulses, 10 Hz, 2-3.4 bars) consisted of three weekly treatment sessions (days 1, 8 and 16). Follow-up data were collected 30, 60 and 90 days after the first session. Data were compared between time points, groups and limbs pairs. RESULTS: At the end of the experimental period, mean PVF and VI values had increased (25.9 to 27.6%BW and 2.1 to 12.7%BW Ã s respectively) in treated limbs, with no significant differences in control limbs; SI values suggest improvement. Mean PVF and VI remained lower in the treated compared to the healthy group following treatment. The VAS scores suggested improvement in pain and lameness in treated dogs. Owner perception data suggested improved levels of physical activity following treatment. Conclusions and clinical significance: Outcomes of this study suggested beneficial effects of RSWT in dogs with hip osteoarthritis.We report on 2 patients who developed widespread cerebral vasospasm and arterial ischemic strokes (AIS) after application of intrathecal (IT) cytarabine. In a 3-year-old child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), left leg weakness, hyperreflexia, and clonus were noted 4 days after her first dose of IT cytarabine during the induction phase of her chemotherapy. Cerebral MRI revealed multiple acute cerebral ischemic infarcts and widespread cerebral vasospasm. A 5-year-old girl complained of right arm and leg pain and began limping 11 days after IT cytarabine. Symptoms progressed to right dense hemiplegia, left gaze deviation, headache, and speech arrest. MRI revealed 2 large cortical areas of diffusion restriction in the right frontal and left parietal lobes. Cerebral magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed irregular narrowing affecting much of the intracranial arterial circulation. Although the first child fully recovered from her neurologic symptoms, the second patient had persistent hemiplegia on follow-up. Including this report, there are now 4 pediatric ALL cases of severe cerebral vasospasm and AIS in the context of IT cytarabine administration, strongly suggesting a true association. Differential diagnosis and management issues are discussed. Along with the more widespread use of MRI and MRA, the true frequency of this severe adverse effect will become clearer in future. For any child with neurologic symptoms within hours or days of receiving IT cytarabine, a low threshold for cerebral imaging with MRI and MRA is recommended.Parastomal hernia is one of the major complications of colostomy with high occurrence. From October 2011 to November 2014, a retrospective study was conducted by analyzing and following up data of 16 patients suffering from parastomal hernia who underwent a hybrid technique repair. The safety and efficacy of the hybrid technique for parastomal hernia repair was investigated in terms of complications. All cases were operated successfully and had no major immediate postoperative complications other than mild abdominal pain in 5 cases. No long-term postoperative complications were reported in the follow-up. The authors found hybrid technique to be safe and effective for parastomal hernia repair with fewer complications.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate success of pulpal anaesthesia of mandibular 1st molar by using 4% articaine in buccal infiltration versus 2% lidocaine in inferior alveolar nerve block. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized control trial. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Operative Dentistry, Sardar Begum Dental College, Gandhara University, Peshawar, from March to August 2014. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and fifty-six emergency patients, who had 1st molar diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis, participated in the study. Subjects were divided into two groups by random allocation. One group received 4% articaine buccal infiltration and the other group received inferior alveolar nerve block of 2% lidocaine. Subjects&rsquo;self-reported pain response was recorded on Heft Parker Visual Analogue Scale after local anaesthetic administration during access cavity preparation and pulp extirpation. RESULTS: Mean age of subjects was 31.46 &plusmn;10.994 years. The success rate of 4% buccal infiltration was 76.9%; whereas the success rate of 2% lidocaine inferior alveolar nerve block was 62.8%. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: 4% articaine buccal infiltration can be considered a viable alternative to 2% lidocaine inferior alveolar nerve block in securing successful pulpal anaesthesia for endodontic therapy.Crohn's disease (CD) is rarely presented with lower GI bleeding (LGIB) which eludes the clinician. A 25-year-old lady with severe rectorrhagia was presented with no history of constipation, diarrhea or abdominal pain. Colonoscopy revealed ulcers in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and terminal ileum. Crohn's pathologic features were detected in the terminal ileum. The bleeding was controlled via supportive care and IV corticosteroid. Recurrent LGIB was managed by prednisolone and azathioprine. The patient had an uneventful recovery. The clinicians should consider CD as a possible diagnosis in severe LGIB. Prednisolone and azathioprine efficiently control acute bleeding episodes and prevent the recurrence.Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease or histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis is an idiopathic, self-limiting disorder and predominantly affects young women. We report a 35-year-old female who presented with soft to firm cervical lymphadenopathy and neck pain. She had multiple enlarged cervical nodes. Examination of other systems was normal. Lymph node biopsy was performed, and the histological features, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis. The Patient was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and low-dose prednisolone. A significant decrease in the size of lymph node and relief of neck pain occurred. During four years of follow-up, the patient developed no malignant disease or systemic and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is rare, clinicians should be aware of this condition as early diagnosis of the disease will lessen concerns of the patient's family.Osteoid osteoma is painful benign tumor. The aim of this study was to report our initial experience using magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound to treat osteoid osteomas. This retrospective single-center study included four patients treated with magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. They presented with severe pain with reduced quality of life and a poor response to clinical treatment. The pre- and post-treatment evaluation comprised computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and focused on quality of life and the impact of pain on daily activities. After treatment, three patients had complete pain resolution with no recurrence. One patient had a recurrence of symptoms after 2Â wk and underwent a new successful treatment with increased energy levels. On average, 13 sonications were administered (8-18 sonications/treatment) with an average energy of 2,003Â J (range: 1,063-3,522Â J). Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound appears to be a feasible, tolerable and effective treatment in selected patients with osteoid osteomas.PURPOSE: To develop evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of skeletally immature patients with subscapularis and lesser tuberosity avulsion injuries. METHODS: We searched the online databases PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) for relevant publications on subscapularis and lesser tuberosity injuries in skeletally immature patients. All publication dates and languages were included. From studies identified, data were extracted to identify patient characteristics, history and physical examination findings, time to diagnosis, results from imaging studies, and treatment outcomes. These findings were combined and descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 32 publications on 60 patients with a mean age of 13.5 Â± 1.7 years. The most common physical examination finding at the time of diagnosis was anterior shoulder pain, followed by subscapularis muscle weakness. The sensitivity of imaging was 16% for radiographs and 95% for magnetic resonance imaging. The median time to diagnosis was 2 months (interquartile range, 1 to 7 months). Of 60 patients, 10 (17%) underwent successful nonoperative treatment. Fifty patients (83%) underwent surgical repair, without differences in clinical outcomes after open versus arthroscopic repair. Five cases (8%) were identified where delayed treatment was associated with suboptimal outcomes and ongoing shoulder pain. CONCLUSIONS: Subscapularis and lesser tuberosity avulsion injuries in skeletally immature patients are most commonly seen in male patients during early adolescence. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in patients with anterior shoulder pain and subscapularis muscle weakness, especially after a fall on an outstretched arm or an eccentric external rotation injury. Magnetic resonance imaging should be considered early, even if radiographic findings are negative. Both open and arthroscopic repairs are effective in restoring function, if fixation respects the soft bone of the lesser tuberosity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of low-quality studies.BACKGROUND: In case of a ruptured bladder with urine leakage into the peritoneal cavity 'reversed autodialysis' can occur, in which urea and creatinine diffuse back into the bloodstream via the peritoneum. This causes clinical signs of pseudorenal failure, with raised concentrations of creatinine and urea. The urea/creatinine ratio does not change. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old female patient experienced increasing abdominal pain 3 days after laparoscopic myomectomy. Acute renal failure was suspected because of increased serum concentrations of creatinine and urea, but no cause could be found. There was a build-up of fluid in the abdominal cavity, which proved to be urine originating from an iatrogenic rupture of the bladder. Serum levels normalised following repair of the rupture. CONCLUSION: If serum creatinine levels rise rapidly following abdominal surgery or blunt abdominal trauma the bladder should be examined for possible perforation, particularly if the abdominal dimension increases. A ruptured bladder leading to pseudorenal failure is an indication for rapid surgical intervention.A 57-year-old patient presented to the orthopaedic department with hip pain 7 months after hip replacement and two weeks after dry needling by a physiotherapist. Dry needling is used by physiotherapists to treat pain and stiffness. In the Netherlands, there are no clear guidelines or contra-indications described for this treatment. The surgical scar of our patient showed signs of inflammation for which debridement and irrigation were performed. Tissue samples showed positive bacterial cultures and the patient was treated with antibiotics. One week after completing this treatment, the infection returned. Debridement and irrigation were repeated and antibiotic treatment was recommenced. Three months later, the patient showed no signs of infection with the prosthesis still in situ. Although there is no strong evidence for a causal relationship between dry needling and the infection, dry needling should be used carefully in patients with a joint replacement, due to the increased risk of infection.Context Opioids have been used as the reference treatment on chronic pain. However, they are related to serious adverse effects which affect the patient compliance to treatment, as well as, his quality of life. Particulate formulations have been investigated as an alternative to improve opioid efficacy and safety. Objective Summarise the available studies concerning micro and nanoencapsulated opioid formulations discussing their biopharmaceutical characteristics, such as composition, size, in vitro release, pharmacokinetic and antinociceptive profile. Methods Papers available in 1995-2015 at Medline, Science Direct and Web of Science databases were collected and assessed. Searches were performed using varied combinations of the keywords of this work. Results Opioid-loaded particles showed prolonged drug release with maintenance of serum therapeutic concentrations and extended analgesia when compared with the free drugs. The side effects incidences were reduced or maintained the same. Conclusion Particulate formulations can significantly increase both potency and safety profiles of opioids.BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCW) in low and middle income countries are at high risk of nosocomial tuberculosis infection. Periodic screening of health workers for both TB disease and infection can play a critical role in TB infection control. Occupational health programs that implement serial tuberculin skin testing (TST) are advised to use a two-step baseline TST. This helps to ensure that boosting of waned immune response is not mistaken as new TB infection (i.e. conversion). However, there are no data on safety of the two-step TST in the Indian context where HCWs are repeatedly exposed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nursing students were recruited from 2007 to 2009 at the Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India. Consenting nursing students were screened with a baseline two-step TST at the time of recruitment. From 2007 to 2008 adverse events were recorded when reported during the TST reading (Cohort A). Nurses recruited in the final study year (2009) answered an investigator administered questionnaire assessing all likely side-effects Cohort B). This information was extracted from the case report forms and analysed. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 09, 800 trainees consented to participate in the annual TB screening study and 779 did not have a past history of TB or recall a positive TST and were selected to administer TST. Of these, 755 returned for reading the result and had complete data and were included for the final analysis - 623 subjects in (cohort A) and 132 in (cohort B). These were included for the final analysis. In cohort A only 1.3% reported adverse events. In cohort B, as per the investigator administered questionnaire; 25% reported minor side effects. Itching and local pain were the most common side effects encountered. There were no major adverse events reported. In particular, the adverse events were similar in the second step of the test and not more severe. CONCLUSION: Screening of HCWs with two-step TST for LTBI is simple and safe, and hence suitable for wide scale implementation in high-burden settings such as India.An unusual case of a patient presenting with a large infected haematoma following a traumatic grade II acromioclavicular joint dislocation is reported. Diagnosis of this rare complication, of an otherwise common self-limiting injury, was delayed until 19âdays postinjury despite several presentations during this time with worsening swelling and pain. The patient was found to have significant tissue destruction by the time washout was performed and required multiple procedures to treat the infection. This case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for complications, even following common self-limiting injuries, when patients represent with symptoms that do not fit the usual natural history of the condition, particularly if they have risk factors for bleeding and infection.The article summarizes current information on blood pressure changes in children during clinic visit. White coat as a general dressing of physicians and health care personnel has been widely accepted at the end of the 19th century. Two problems can be associated with the use of white coat: white coat phenomenon and white coat hypertension. Children often attribute pain and other unpleasant experience to the white coat and refuse afterwards cooperation with examinations. Definition of white coat hypertension in the literature is not uniform. It has been defined as elevated blood pressure in the hospital or clinic with normal blood pressure at home measured during the day by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system. White coat effect is defined as temporary increase in blood pressure before and during visit in the clinic, regardless what the average daily ambulatory blood pressure values are. Clinical importance of white coat hypertension is mainly because of higher risk for cardiovascular accidents that are dependent on end organ damage (heart, vessels, kidney). Current data do not allow any clear recommendations for the treatment. Pharmacological therapy is usually started in the presence of hypertrophic left ventricle, changes in intimal/medial wall thickness of carotic arteries, microalbuminuria and other cardiovascular risk factors. Nonpharmacological therapy is less controversial and certainly more appropriate. Patients have to change their life style, need to eliminate as much cardiovascular risk factors as possible and sustain a regular blood pressure monitoring.Many of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders are marked by prominent disturbances of cognition and emotion. Characterizing the complex neural circuitry underlying the interplay of cognition and emotion is critically important, not just for clarifying the nature of the mind, but also for discovering the root causes of a broad spectrum of debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia, and chronic pain.Pericardial cysts are uncommon lesions usually found incidentally upon the radiologic investigation of some other condition. The aetiology can be both congenital and acquired (post inflammatory processes, infection or even posttraumatic). They are the most common benign tumour of the pericardium but there is still a difficulty in the differential diagnosis because even clinical or analytically are not different from some other benign or malignant lesions. Further image studies are required to complete the study of these lesions. Even the majority are asymptomatic (>50%), the localization and relation to adjacent structures lead the role of the clinical manifestations (persistent cough, dyspnoea, chest pain...). We present the case of a man with oppressive chest pain after 2 weeks of thoracic traumatism with an abnormal radiological image in the chest X-ray.The case of a patient with Steinert disease who underwent surgery for radical hysterectomy is presented. Because of her advanced disease, she suffered from chronic respiratory failure which required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at night. Spinal anaesthesia was chosen as an anaesthetic treatment. At the time of aortic lymphadenectomy, the patient reported moderate pain at hypogastrium, which was well controlled with boluses of 10 mg of ketamine. Postoperatively, opioid administration was avoided by applying abdominal wall blocks: transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block and sheath of rectus abdominis muscle block. The evolution of the patient was satisfactory and she was discharged on the fifth day after surgery.OBJECTIVE: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common problem that affects up to 30% of all surgical patients after general anaesthesia, which increases in sinonasal surgery due the very potent emetic effect of ingested blood that is swallowed during the procedures. Therefore, a hypo/oropharyngeal packing is commonly placed in an effort to prevent blood ingestion. The primary aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of 3 packing types in preventing PONV and to compare the results with patients who received no packing. The secondary aim was to compare the postoperative throat pain in all 4 groups. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective double-blind randomized controlled study. SETTING: A university hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, 201 adult patients scheduled for sinonasal surgery were randomized to 4 groups to have dry packing (n = 52), packing soaked with water (n = 48), packing soaked with chlorhexidine gluconate and benzydamine hydrochloride (n = 51), or no packing (n = 50). Postoperative PONV and throat pain were assessed. RESULTS: Demographic data, procedural characteristics, and PONV risk scores were similar among groups. The PONV incidences, throat pain scores, and analgesic use were comparable in all 4 groups. CONCLUSION: Despite commonly used practices, usage of different types of pharyngeal packing did not affect incidence of PONV and throat pain, nor did usage of no packing.An 85-year-old woman with longstanding atrial fibrillation and complete atrioventricular block was referred for coil embolization for diverticular bleeding of the colon. Four days after the procedure, she complained of chest pain. A 12-lead echocardiogram (ECG) showed bidirectional ventricular rhythm (VR), which was hemodynamically stable (Figure 1A).

Shoulder injuries are common and result in the longest time off sport for any joint injury in rugby. The most common injuries are to the glenohumeral joint with varying degrees of instability. The degree of instability can guide management. The three main types of instability presentations are: (1) frank dislocation, (2) subluxations and (3) subclinical instability with pain and clicking. Understanding the exact mechanism of injury can guide diagnosis with classical patterns of structural injuries. The standard clinical examination in a large, muscular athlete may be normal, so specific tests and techniques are needed to unearth signs of pathology. Taking these factors into consideration, along with the imaging, allows a treatment strategy. However, patient and sport factors need to be also considered, particularly the time of the season and stage of sporting career. Surgery to repair the structural damage should include all lesions found. In chronic, recurrent dislocations with major structural lesions, reconstruction procedures such as the Latarjet procedure yields better outcomes. Rehabilitation should be safe, goal-driven and athlete-specific. Return to sport is dependent on a number of factors, driven by the healing process, sport requirements and extrinsic pressures. Level of evidence V.BACKGROUND: A recent prospective randomized trial demonstrated that prophylactic pasireotide reduces the incidence of pancreatic complications (PC) after resection. This secondary analysis aimed to describe quality of life (QoL) before and after resection, to characterize the impact of PC on QoL, and to assess whether pasireotide improves QoL. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of preoperative pasireotide in patients undergoing pancreatectomy was conducted. Participants completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) C30 and PAN26 modules preoperatively and on postoperative days 14 and 60. Scores were compared using t tests. The percentage of patients with clinically important worsening (a decline â¥0.5 times the baseline standard deviation) was reported. RESULTS: All questionnaires were completed by 87Â % (260/300) of the patients. No major differences were observed between the pasireotide and placebo groups. Therefore, the data were pooled for further analyses. A significant worsening of function at 14Â days was detected on all the PAN26 and C30 function scales except hepatic and emotional functioning (EF), and on all the C30 symptom scales. More than 75Â % of the patients experienced clinically important worsening of fatigue, pain, and role functioning. Most effects persisted at 60Â days, with the 60-day EF significantly better than at baseline (pÂ =Â 0.03). PC were associated with worse outcomes on most function scales. CONCLUSIONS: During the 14Â days after resection, patients can be expected to have a significant decline in QoL. Many symptoms abate by 60Â days, and EF improves. PC were associated with impaired QoL in several domains. Although pasireotide effectively reduced PC, its effect did not appear to translate to improved QoL in this sample of 300 patients.BACKGROUND: Several Brazilian studies have addressed the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), but few have analyzed the knowledge of the health professionals with regards to the ICF. OBJECTIVE: To verify whether the classification of the items in the Brazilian-Portuguese versions of The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and The Disabilities Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, obtained from health professionals who worked with patients having upper limb injuries, could be related to ICF components as defined by others studies. METHOD: There were 4 participants for the group "professionals with high familiarity of the ICF (PHF)" and 19 for the group of "professionals with some or no familiarity of the ICF (PSNF)". The participants judged whether the items on the two questionnaires belonged to the ICF body function, body structure or activity-participation component, and marked a confidence level for each trial using a numerical scale ranging from zero to 10. The items were classified by the discriminant content validity method using the Student'st-test and the Hochberg correction. The ratings were compared to the literature by the percentage of agreement and Kappa coefficient. RESULTS: The percentage of agreement of the rating from the PSNF and the PHF groups with the literature was equal to or greater than 77%. For the DASH, the agreement of the PSNF and PHF groups with the literature were, respectively, moderate (Kappa=0.46 to 0.48) and substantial (Kappa=0.62 to 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals were able to correlate the three components of the ICF for most items on the 2 questionnaires, demonstrating some ease of understanding the ICF components. However, the relation of concept of pain with body function component is not clear for professional and deserves a more attentive approach.BACKGROUND: The risk factors for the development of plantar fasciitis (PF) have been associated with the medial longitudinal arch (MLA), rearfoot alignment and calcaneal overload. However, the relationships between the biomechanical variables have yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships between the MLA, rearfoot alignment, and dynamic plantar loads in runners with unilateral PF in acute and chronic phases. METHOD: Cross-sectional study which thirty-five runners with unilateral PF were evaluated: 20 in the acute phase (with pain) and 15 with previous chronic PF (without pain). The MLA index and rearfoot alignment were calculated using digital images. The contact area, maximum force, peak pressure, and force-time integral over three plantar areas were acquired with Pedar X insoles while running at 12 km/h, and the loading rates were calculated from the vertical forces. RESULTS: The multiple regression analyses indicated that both the force-time integral (R2=0.15 for acute phase PF; R2=0.17 for chronic PF) and maximum force (R2=0.35 for chronic PF) over the forefoot were predicted by an elevated MLA index. The rearfoot valgus alignment predicted the maximum force over the rearfoot in both PF groups: acute (R2=0.18) and chronic (R2=0.45). The rearfoot valgus alignment also predicted higher loading rates in the PF groups: acute (R2=0.19) and chronic (R2=0.40). CONCLUSION: The MLA index and the rearfoot alignment were good predictors of plantar loads over the forefoot and rearfoot areas in runners with PF. However, rearfoot valgus was demonstrated to be an important clinical measure, since it was able to predict the maximum force and both loading rates over the rearfoot.BACKGROUND: The Ambu Smart-Infuser Pain Pump and the On-Q Pump with Select-a-Flow Variable Rate Controller are elastomeric devices with a flow regulator that controls the rate of infusion of a local anesthetic agent through a peripheral catheter. As a safety evaluation, we evaluated the infusion characteristics of these two devices when filled with manufacturer recommended standard volumes and when overfilled with a volume 50% in excess of that which is recommended. METHODS: Nineteen disposable devices from the two manufacturers were used in this study. Nine were filled with 0.9% normal saline according to the respective manufacturers' recommendations (four Ambu pumps were filled with 650 ml and five On-Q pumps were filled with 550 ml) and 10 devices were 150% overfilled (five Ambu pumps were filled with 975 ml and five On-Q pumps were filled with 825 ml). All of the devices were set to infuse at 10 mlÂ·h(-1) at room temperature (21Â°C) for 12 h. The fluid delivered during each 2-h period was measured using a graduated column. RESULTS: The On-Q pump (in the settings of normal fill and 150% overfill) delivered a significantly higher output per hour than the set rate during the first 8 h, while the Ambu pump delivered a value close to the set rate of 10 mlÂ·h(-1) . No significant difference in the hourly delivered output was noted for either device when comparing the normal fill to the 150% overfill groups. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation demonstrates that no change in the hourly output occurs with overfilling of these home infusion devices. However, as noted previously, the hourly output from the On-Q device is significantly higher than the set rate during the initial 8 h of infusion which could have potential clinical implications.BACKGROUND: Tibia fracture followed by cast immobilization in rats evokes nociceptive, vascular, epidermal, and bone changes resembling complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In most cases, CRPS has three stages. Over time, this acute picture, allodynia, warmth, and edema observed at 4Â weeks, gives way to a cold, dystrophic but still painful limb. In the acute phase (at 4Â weeks post fracture), cutaneous immunological and NK1-receptor signaling mechanisms underlying CRPS have been discovered; however, the mechanisms responsible for the chronic phase are still unknown. The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the chronic phases of CRPS (at 16Â weeks post fracture) at both the peripheral and central levels. METHODS: We used rat tibial fracture/cast immobilization model of CRPS to study molecular, vascular, and nociceptive changes at 4 and 16Â weeks post fracture. Immunoassays and Western blotting were carried out to monitor changes in inflammatory response and NK1-receptor signaling in the skin and spinal cord. Skin temperature and thickness were measured to elucidate vascular changes, whereas von Frey testing and unweighting were carried out to study nociceptive changes. All data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Neuman-Keuls multiple comparison test to compare among all cohorts. RESULTS: In the acute phase (at 4Â weeks post fracture), hindpaw allodynia, unweighting, warmth, edema, and/or epidermal thickening were observed among 90Â % fracture rats, though by 16Â weeks (chronic phase), only the nociceptive changes persisted. The expression of the neuropeptide signaling molecule substance P (SP), NK1 receptor, inflammatory mediators TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 and nerve growth factor (NGF) were elevated at 4Â weeks in sciatic nerve and/or skin, returning to normal levels by 16Â weeks post fracture. The systemic administration of a peripherally restricted IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) or of anti-NGF inhibited nociceptive behaviors at 4Â weeks but not 16Â weeks. However, spinal levels of NK1 receptor, TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², and NGF were elevated at 4 and 16Â weeks, and intrathecal injection of an NK1-receptor antagonist (LY303870), anakinra, or anti-NGF each reduced nociceptive behaviors at both 4 and 16Â weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that tibia fracture and immobilization cause peripheral changes in neuropeptide signaling and inflammatory mediator production acutely, but central spinal changes may be more important for the persistent nociceptive changes in this CRPS model.BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in maternity healthcare services over the last few decades, more than 2.7 million babies worldwide are stillborn each year. The global health agenda is silent about stillbirth, perhaps, in part, because its wider impact has not been systematically analysed or understood before now across the world. Our study aimed to systematically review, evaluate and summarise the current evidence regarding the psychosocial impact of stillbirth to parents and their families, with the aim of improving guidance in bereavement care worldwide. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-summary (quantitative aggregation of qualitative findings) of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies. All languages and countries were included. RESULTS: Two thousand, six hundred and nineteen abstracts were identified; 144 studies were included. Frequency effect sizes (FES %) were calculated for each theme, as a measure of their prevalence in the literature. Themes ranged from negative psychological symptoms post bereavement (77âÂ·â1) and in subsequent pregnancies (27âÂ·â1), to disenfranchised grief (31âÂ·â2), and incongruent grief (28âÂ·â5), There was also impact on siblings (23âÂ·â6) and on the wider family (2âÂ·â8). They included mixed-feelings about decisions made when the baby died (12âÂ·â5), avoidance of memories (13âÂ·â2), anxiety over other children (7âÂ·â6), chronic pain and fatigue (6âÂ·â9), and a different approach to the use of healthcare services (6âÂ·â9). Some themes were particularly prominent in studies of fathers; grief suppression (avoidance)(18âÂ·â1), employment difficulties, financial debt (5âÂ·â6), and increased substance use (4âÂ·â2). Others found in studies specific to mothers included altered body image (3âÂ·â5) and impact on quality of life (2âÂ·â1). Counter-intuitively, Some themes had mixed connotations. These included parental pride in the baby (5âÂ·â6), motivation for engagement in healthcare improvement (4âÂ·â2) and changed approaches to life and death, self-esteem, and own identity (25âÂ·â7). In studies from low/middle income countries, stigmatisation (13âÂ·â2) and pressure to prioritise or delay conception (9) were especially prevalent. CONCLUSION: Experiencing the birth of a stillborn child is a life-changing event. The focus of the consequences may vary with parent gender and country. Stillbirth can have devastating psychological, physical and social costs, with ongoing effects on interpersonal relationships and subsequently born children. However, parents who experience the tragedy of stillbirth can develop resilience and new life-skills and capacities. Future research should focus on developing interventions that may reduce the psychosocial cost of stillbirth.OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy between subcuticular sutures and staples for skin closure after cesarean delivery. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched. Only RCTs comparing subcuticular sutures to staples following cesarean delivery were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of wound complications, consisting of wound infection, wound separation, hematoma and seroma. Risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% conï¬dence interval (CI) was calculated. RESULTS: Ten RCTs were included in this analysis. Subcuticular sutures were associated with significantly decreased incidence of wound complications compared to staples (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.45-2.45). The operation time was significantly shortened when closure with staples was performed (MD -8.66 min, 95% CI -10.90 to -6.42). The two groups were comparable regarding cosmetic outcome at 6-8 weeks postoperatively, whereas subcuticular sutures were associated with a better cosmesis at 6-12 months postoperatively. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of hospital stay, postoperative pain and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with staples following cesarean delivery, subcuticular sutures are associated with decreased risk of wound complications and better long-term cosmetic outcome, but slightly prolong duration of surgery.Ch14.18 manufactured in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Short-term infusion (STI) (8-20Â h/day; 4-5Â days) of 100Â mg/m(2) ch14.18/CHO (dinutiximab beta) per cycle in combination with cytokines is standard treatment of neuroblastoma (NB) patients. As pain is a limiting factor, we investigated a novel delivery method by continuous long-term infusion (LTI) of 100Â mg/m(2) over 10Â days. 53Â NB patients were treated with 5-6 cycles of 6Ã10(6) IU/m(2) subcutaneous interleukin-2 (d 1-5, 8-12), LTI of 100Â mg/m(2) ch14.18/CHO (d 8-18) and 160Â mg/m(2) oral 13-cis-retinoic acid (d 22-35). Human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity were determined. With LTI, we observed a maximum concentration of ch14.18/CHO (Cmax) of 12.56Â±0.68Â Î¼g/ml and a terminal half-life time (t1/2 Î²) of 32.7Â±16.2Â d. The clearance values for LTI and STI of 0.54Â±0.13 and 0.41Â±0.29Â L/d m(2) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) values of 189.6Â±41.4 and 284.8Â±156.8Â Î¼gÃd/ml, respectively, were not significantly different. Importantly, we detected ch14.18/CHO trough concentration of â¥ 1Â Î¼g/ml at time points preceding subsequent antibody infusions after cycle 1, allowing a persistent activation of antibody effector mechanisms over the entire treatment period of 6Â months. HACA responses were observed in 10/53 (19%) patients, similar to STI (21%), indicating LTI had no effect on the immunogenicity of ch14.18/CHO. In conclusion, LTI of ch14.18/CHO induced effector mechanisms over the entire treatment period, and may therefore emerge as the preferred delivery method of anti-GD2 immunotherapy to NB patients.BACKGROUND: Although most patients achieve favorable results following bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty (BHA), some experience rapid migration of the prosthesis. We retrospectively reviewed 18 patients with BHA that necessitated revision. METHODS: We examined soft tissues obtained from periprosthetic lesions. In total, 18 patients with pain and acetabular migration of the BHA prosthesis were included. The patients were divided into a polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-positive (â¥5 PMNs per high-power field [HPF]) and PMN-negative (<5 PMNs/HPF) group. RESULTS: Pathological findings showed that 11 patients were PMN-positive, which was indicative of infection. All patients in the PMN-positive group showed no polyethylene particles or foreign body giant cells, while all patients in the PMN-negative group showed polyethylene debris or foreign body giant cells (pâ<â0.001). BHA survival, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) hip score were significantly different between the PMN-positive and PMN-negative group (pâ<â0.01). A BHA survival cut-off value of 3270Â days was diagnostic for PMN positivity (sensitivity: 100Â %; specificity: 100Â %). The cut-off values for CRP and the JOA hip score were 0.43Â mg/dl and 56 points, respectively. Four of 11 PMN-positive patients showed no clinical symptoms of infection (asymptomatic PMN-positive group). BHA survival, CRP levels, and JOA hip scores were significantly different between the asymptomatic PMN-positive and PMN-negative group (pâ<â0.05). A BHA survival cut-off of 3270Â days was diagnostic for asymptomatic PMN positivity (sensitivity: 100Â %; specificity: 100Â %). The cut-off values for CRP and the JOA hip score were 0.43Â mg/dl and 57 points, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that some portion of rapid BHA prosthesis migration is caused by mild infection. Careful pathological examination should be performed to identify infection before removal of the BHA prosthesis in patients who develop migration within 9Â years.Chronic pain is a prevalent health issue with one in five people suffering from some form of chronic pain, with loss of productivity and medical costs of chronic pain considerable. However, the treatment of pain can be difficult, as pain perception is complex and can be affected by factors other than tissue damage. This study investigated the effect of hypohydration (mild, voluntary dehydration from â¼24 h of limiting fluid intake, mimicking someone drinking less than usual) on a person's pain perception. Seventeen healthy males (age 27âÂ±â5 years) visited the laboratory on three occasions, once as a familiarization and then twice again while either euhydrated (urine specific gravity: 1.008âÂ±â0.005) or hypohydrated (urine specific gravity: 1.024âÂ±â0.003, and -1.4âÂ±â0.9% body mass). Each visit, they performed a cold pressor test, where their feet were placed in cold water (0-3Â°C) for a maximum of 4 min. Measures of hydration status, pain sensitivity, pain threshold, and catastrophization were taken. We found that hypohydration predicted increased pain sensitivity (Î²â=â0.43), trait pain catastrophizing, and baseline pain sensitivity (Î²â=â0.37 and 0.47, respectively). These results are consistent with previous research, and suggest that a person's hydration status may be an important factor in their perception of acute pain.BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (QoL) is of major importance in pancreatic cancer, owing to the limited life expectation. The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to describe QoL in patients undergoing resection for pancreatic or periampullary malignancy. METHODS: QoL was measured on a scale of 0-100 in patients who underwent pancreatic resection for malignancy or premalignancy at the University Medical Centre Utrecht before resection, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Measures consisted of the RAND-36, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the EORTC pancreatic cancer-specific module (QLQ-PAN26). RESULTS: Between March 2012 and November 2013, 68 consecutive patients with a malignancy (59 patients) or premalignancy (9) were included. Physical role restriction, social and emotional domains showed a significant and clinically relevant deterioration directly after operation in 53 per cent (RAND-36, P < 0Â·001), 63 and 78 per cent (QLQ-C30 and RAND-36 respectively, P < 0Â·001) and 37 per cent (RAND-36, P < 0Â·001) of patients respectively. Most domains demonstrated recovery to preoperative values or better at 3 months, except for physical functioning. Emotional functioning at 3, 6 and 12 months was better than at baseline (P < 0Â·001). Symptom scores revealed a deterioration in vitality, pain (P = 0Â·002), fatigue (P < 0Â·001), appetite loss (P < 0Â·001), altered bowel habit (P = 0Â·001) and side-effects (P < 0Â·001) after 1 month. After 3 months, only side-effects were worse than preoperative values (P < 0Â·001). CONCLUSION: QoL after pancreatic resection for malignant and premalignant tumours decreased considerably in the early postoperative phase. Full recovery of QoL took up to 6 months after the operation.PMID: 26785437  [PubMed - in process]BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a major health burden in India. The objective of the study was to establish a neonatal screening program and to understand the clinical course of children with SCD in central India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Pregnant mothers were screened for sickle hemoglobin using the solubility test. Babies were screened by high performance liquid chromatography if the mother was positive for sickle hemoglobin. The diagnosis was confirmed by molecular analysis. They received early prophylactic treatment and vaccination. Of 2134 newborns screened, 104 were sickle homozygous (SS), seven had sickle Î²-thalassemia (S-Î² thal) and 978 were sickle heterozygous (AS). The other hemoglobin abnormalities detected included HbS -Î´Î² thalassemia-1, HbSD disease-2, HbE traits-5, Î²-thalassemia traits-4, alpha chain variants-3 and HbH disease-1.These babies were followed up regularly for hematological and clinical evaluation. Pain, severe anemia requiring blood transfusions and acute febrile illness were the major complications with 59.7, 45.1 and 42.6 cases per 100 person years. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels were inversely associated with vaso-oclussive crisis (VOC) and severe anemia while presence of alpha thalassemia increased the rate of painful events and sepsis. Six early deaths occurred among the SS babies. CONCLUSION: A systematic follow up of this first newborn SCD cohort in central India showed that 47% of babies presented within 1 year of age. In spite of the presence of the Arab-Indian haplotype many babies had severe manifestations.Our laboratories are developing treadmill-based gait analysis employing sheep to investigate potential efficacy of intra-dural spinal cord stimulation in the treatment of spinal cord injury and neuropathic pain. As part of efforts to establish the performance characteristics of the experimental arrangement, this study measured the treadmill speed via a tachometer, video belt-marker timing and ambulation-rate observations of the sheep. The data reveal a 0.1-0.3% residual drift in the baseline (unloaded) treadmill speed which increases with loading, but all three approaches agree on final speed to within 1.7%, at belt speeds of â4 km/h. Using the tachometer as the standard, the estimated upper limit on uncertainty in the video belt-marker approach isâÂ±â0.18âkmâh(-1) and the measured uncertainty is Â±â0.15âkmâh(-1). Employment of the latter method in determining timing differences between contralateral hoof strikes by the sheep suggests its utility in assessing severity of SCI and responses to therapeutic interventions.PMID: 26785324  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]Patients with functional pain disorders often complain of generalized sensory hypersensitivity, finding sounds, smells, or even everyday light aversive. The neural basis for this aversion is unknown, but cannot be attributed to a general increase in cortical sensory processing. Here we quantified the threshold for aversion to light in patients with fibromyalgia, a pain disorder thought to reflect dysregulation of brain pain-modulating systems. These individuals expressed discomfort at light levels substantially lower than healthy controls. Complementary studies in lightly anesthetized rat demonstrated that a subset of identified pain-modulating neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla unexpectedly responds to light. Approximately half of the pain-facilitating "ON-cells" and pain-inhibiting "OFF-cells" sampled exhibited a change in firing with light exposure, shifting the system to a pro-nociceptive state with activation of ON-cells and suppression of OFF-cell firing. The change in neuronal firing did not require a trigeminal or posterior thalamic relay, but was blocked by inactivation of the olivary pretectal nucleus. Light exposure also resulted in a measurable but modest decrease in the threshold for heat-evoked paw withdrawal, as would be expected with engagement of this pain-modulating circuitry.These data demonstrate integration of information about light intensity with somatic input at the level of single pain-modulating neurons in the brainstem of the rat under basal conditions. Taken together, our findings in rodents and humans provide a novel mechanism for abnormal photosensitivity, and suggest that light has the potential to engage pain-modulating systems such that normally innocuous inputs are perceived as aversive or even painful.High frequency spontaneous firing in myelinated sensory neurons plays a key role in initiating pain behaviors in several different models, including the radicular pain model in which the rat lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are locally inflamed. The sodium channel isoform NaV1.6 contributes to pain behaviors and spontaneous activity in this model. Among all the isoforms in adult DRG, NaV1.6 is the main carrier of TTX-sensitive resurgent Na currents that allow high-frequency firing. Resurgent currents flow after a depolarization or action potential, as a blocking particle exits the pore. In most neurons the regulatory Î²4 subunit is potentially the endogenous blocker. We used in vivo siRNA mediated knockdown of NaVÎ²4 to examine its role in the DRG inflammation model. NaVÎ²4 but not control siRNA almost completely blocked mechanical hypersensitivity induced by DRG inflammation. Microelectrode recordings in isolated whole DRGs showed that NaVÎ²4 siRNA blocked the inflammation-induced increase in spontaneous activity of AÎ² neurons, and reduced repetitive firing and other measures of excitability. NaVÎ²4 was preferentially expressed in larger diameter cells; DRG inflammation increased its expression and this was reversed by NaVÎ²4 siRNA, based on immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. NaVÎ²4 siRNA also reduced immunohistochemical NaV1.6 expression. Patch clamp recordings of TTX-sensitive Na currents in acutely cultured medium diameter DRG neurons showed that DRG inflammation increased transient and especially resurgent current; effects blocked by NaVÎ²4 siRNA. NaVÎ²4 may represent a more specific target for pain conditions that depend on myelinated neurons expressing NaV1.6.Little is known about long-term pain and function outcomes among patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) initiating chronic opioid therapy (COT). In the Middle-Aged/Seniors Chronic Opioid Therapy (MASCOT) study of patients identified through electronic pharmacy records as initiating COT for CNCP, we examined the relationships between level of opioid use (over the 120 days prior to outcome assessment) and pain and activity interference outcomes at 4- and 12-month follow-ups. Patients aged 45+ years (N = 1,477) completed a baseline interview; 1,311 and 1,157 of these comprised the 4- and 12-month analysis samples, respectively. Opioid use was classified based on self-report and electronic pharmacy records for the 120 days prior to the 4- and 12-month outcome assessments. Controlling for patient characteristics that predict sustained COT and pain outcomes, patients who had used opioids minimally or not at all, compared to those with intermittent/lower-dose and regular/higher-dose opioid use, had better pain intensity and activity interference outcomes. Adjusted mean (95% CI) pain intensity (0-10 scale) at 12 months was 4.91 (4.68, 5.13) for the minimal/no use group and 5.71 (5.50, 5.92) and 5.72 (5.51, 5.93) for the intermittent/lower-dose and regular/higher-dose groups, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for pain intensity at 4 months and for activity interference at both time points. Better outcomes in the minimal/no use group could reflect pain improvement leading to opioid discontinuation. The similarity in outcomes of regular/higher-dose and intermittent/lower-dose opioid users suggests that intermittent and/or lower-dose use versus higher-dose use may confer risk reduction without reducing benefits.Over the last decade, the apparent increase in placebo responses in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of neuropathic pain have complicated and potentially limited development and availability of new effective pain medication. Placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia effects are well described in nociceptive and idiopathic pain conditions, but less is known about the magnitude and mechanisms of placebo and nocebo effects in neuropathic pain. In neuropathic pain, placebo treatments have primarily been used as control conditions for active agents under investigation in RCTs and these placebo responses are typically not controlled for the natural history of pain and other confounding factors. Recently, mechanistic studies that control for the natural history of pain have investigated placebo and nocebo effects in neuropathic pain in their own right. Large placebo analgesia but no nocebo hyperalgesic effects have been found, and the underlying mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated. Here we review placebo and nocebo effects and the underlying mechanisms in neuropathic pain and compare them with those of nociceptive and idiopathic pain. This allows for a novel discussion on how knowledge of psychological, neurobiological, and genetic factors underlying well-controlled placebo effects may help improve the information that can be obtained from and potentially restore the utility of RCTs.A significant proportion of children and adolescents with chronic pain endorse elevated pain-related fear. Pain-related fear is associated with high levels of disability, depressive symptoms, and school impairment. Because of faulty nerve signaling, individuals with neuropathic pain and complex regional pain syndrome may be more prone to develop pain-related fear as they avoid use of and neglect the affected body area(s), resulting in exacerbated symptoms, muscle atrophy, maintenance of pain signaling, and ongoing pain-related disability. Not surprisingly, effective treatments for elevated pain-related fears involve exposure to previously avoided activities to downregulate incorrect pain signaling. In the context of intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment of youth with neuropathic pain, decreasing pain-related fear is associated with improved physical and psychological functioning, whereas high initial pain-related fear is a risk factor for less treatment responsiveness. An innovative approach to targeting pain-related fear and evidence of a neural response to treatment involving decoupling of the amygdala with key fear circuits in youth with complex regional pain syndrome suggest breakthroughs in our ability to ameliorate these issues.The treatment of neuropathic pain by neuromodulation is an objective for more than 40 years in modern clinical practice. With respect to spinal cord and deep brain structures, the cerebral cortex is the most recently evaluated target of invasive neuromodulation therapy for pain. In the early 90s, the first successes of invasive epidural motor cortex stimulation (EMCS) were published. A few years later was developed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive stimulation technique. Then, electrical transcranial stimulation returned valid and is currently in full development, with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Regarding transcranial approaches, the main studied and validated target was still the motor cortex, but other cortical targets are under investigation. The mechanisms of action of these techniques share similarities, especially between EMCS and rTMS, but they also have differences that could justify specific indications and applications. It is therefore important to know the principles and to assess the merit of these techniques on the basis of a rigorous assessment of the results, to avoid fad. Various types of chronic neuropathic pain syndromes can be significantly relieved by EMCS or repeated daily sessions of high-frequency (5-20 Hz) rTMS or anodal tDCS over weeks, at least when pain is lateralized and stimulation is applied to the motor cortex contralateral to pain side. However, cortical stimulation therapy remains to be optimized, especially by improving EMCS electrode design, rTMS targeting, or tDCS montage, to reduce the rate of nonresponders, who do not experience clinically relevant effects of these techniques.Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects up to 50% of patients with diabetes and is a major cause of morbidity and increased mortality. Its clinical manifestations include distressing painful neuropathic symptoms and insensitivity to trauma that result in foot ulcerations and amputations. Several recent studies have implicated poor glycemic control, duration of diabetes, hyperlipidemia (particularly hypertryglyceridaemia), elevated albumin excretion rates, and obesity as risk factors for the development of DPN. However, similar data are not available for painful DPN. Moreover, although there is now strong evidence for the importance of peripheral nerve microvascular disease in the pathogenesis of DPN, peripheral structural biomarkers of painful DPN are lacking. However, there is now emerging evidence for the involvement of the central nervous system in both painful and painless DPN afforded by magnetic resonance imaging. This review will focus on this emerging evidence for central changes in DPN, hitherto considered a peripheral nerve disease only.A workshop of the 2015 International Neuropathic Pain Congress was focused on potassium channels to propose emerging ideas on the role of these channels on pain modulation and to determine whether they can become relevant targets for designing novel analgesic compounds. Two kinds of potassium channels were particularly evoked: selected subunits of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) and of the K2P channel families. In this review, the role of the former is described with a focus first on silent subunits as modulators of Kv and second on the Kv7 subunits. The physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological involvement of the K2P in pain modulation is then described. Throughout this review, the role of potassium channels in pain is obvious, which renders them potential targets for innovative analgesics with peripheral and/or central action depending on the channel. Clearly, some preliminary results obtained with known or novel potassium channel openers suggest that they might represent a novel class of analgesics in neuropathic pain or other pathological contexts.Brain responses to nociception are well identified. The same is not true for allodynic pain, a strong painful sensation in response to touch or innocuous cold stimuli that may be experienced by patients with neuropathic pain. Brain (or spinal cord) reorganization that may explain this paradoxical perception still remains largely unknown. Allodynic pain is associated with abnormally increased activity in SII and in the anterior insular cortex, contralateral and/or ipsilateral to allodynia. Because a bilateral increase in activity has been repeatedly reported in these areas in nociceptive conditions, the observed activation during allodynia can explain that a physiologically nonpainful stimulus could be perceived by the damaged nervous system as a painful one. Both secondary somatosensory and insular cortices receive input from the thalamus, which is a major relay of sensory and spinothalamic pathways, the involvement of which is known to be crucial for the development of neuropathic pain. Both thalamic function and structure have been reported to be abnormal or impaired in neuropathic pain conditions including in the basal state, possibly explaining the spontaneous component of neuropathic pain. A further indication as to how the brain can create neuropathic pain response in SII and insular cortices stems from examples of diseases, including single-case reports in whom a focal brain lesion leads to central pain disappearance. Additional studies are required to certify the contribution of these areas to the disease processes, to disentangle abnormalities respectively related to pain and to deafferentation, and, in the future, to guide targeting of stimulation studies.Neuropathic pain, ie, pain arising directly from a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory afferent pathway, manifests with various symptoms, the commonest being ongoing burning pain, electrical shock-like sensations, and dynamic mechanical allodynia. Reliable insights into the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain symptoms come from diagnostic tests documenting and quantifying somatosensory afferent pathway damage in patients with painful neuropathies. Neurophysiological investigation and skin biopsy studies suggest that ongoing burning pain primarily reflects spontaneous activity in nociceptive-fiber pathways. Electrical shock-like sensations presumably arise from high-frequency ectopic bursts generated in demyelinated, nonnociceptive, AÎ² fibers. Although the mechanisms underlying dynamic mechanical allodynia remain debatable, normally innocuous stimuli might cause pain by activating spared and sensitized nociceptive afferents. Extending the mechanistic approach to neuropathic pain symptoms might advance targeted therapy for the individual patient and improve testing for new drugs.Human surrogate models of neuropathic pain in healthy subjects are used to study symptoms, signs, and the hypothesized underlying mechanisms. Although different models are available, different spontaneous and evoked symptoms and signs are inducible; 2 key questions need to be answered: are human surrogate models conceptually valid, ie, do they share the sensory phenotype of neuropathic pain states, and are they sufficiently reliable to allow consistent translational research?Neuropathic pain affects up to 10% of the general population, but drug treatments recommended for the treatment of neuropathic pain are associated with modest efficacy and/or produce dose-limiting side effects. Hence, neuropathic pain is an unmet medical need. In the past 2 decades, research on the pathobiology of neuropathic pain has revealed many novel pain targets for use in analgesic drug discovery programs. However, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful as molecules that showed promising pain relief in rodent models of neuropathic pain generally failed to produce analgesia in early phase clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain. One notable exception is the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor that has clinical validity on the basis of a successful double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of EMA401, a highly selective, orally active, peripherally restricted AT2 receptor antagonist in patients with postherpetic neuralgia. In this study, we review research to date on target validation, efficacy, and mode of action of small molecule AT2 receptor antagonists in rodent models of peripheral neuropathic pain and in cultured human sensory neurons, the preclinical pharmacokinetics of these compounds, and the outcome of the above clinical trial.The research of new therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain represents a major current priority. Important drawbacks to advance in the development of these therapies are the limited translational value of the animal models now available and the elucidation of the complex neuronal and immune pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain. One of the neurotransmitter systems participating in neuropathic pain control that has recently raised a particular interest is the endocannabinoid system. This system is highly expressed in neurons and immune cells, and it plays a crucial role in the development of neuropathic pain. Preclinical studies have provided important findings, revealing the potential interest of the endocannabinoid system for the treatment of neuropathic pain. These studies have reported the analgesic effects of cannabinoid agonists in multiple neuropathic pain models, and they have identified specific targets within this system to develop more effective and safe analgesic compounds. However, further studies using more relevant neuropathic pain animal models are required to confirm these interesting results. Several clinical studies suggest that cannabinoids significantly reduced neuropathic pain, although most of these trials fail the required standards of quality. The different pain patient populations included in the systematic reviews also make it difficult to get adequate conclusions. Therefore, additional clinical trials that consider an adequate number of patients, the use active treatments as controls, and longer duration of administration are required to have an adequate profile of the effectiveness and safety of cannabinoids in neuropathic pain.Substantial evidence has implicated microglia in neuropathic pain. After peripheral nerve injury, microglia in the spinal cord proliferate and increase cell-surface expression of the purinergic receptor P2X4. Activation of P2X4 receptors results in release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which acts on neurons to produce disinhibition of dorsal horn neurons which transmit nociceptive information to the brain. Disinhibition of these neurons produces pain hypersensitivity, a hallmark symptom of neuropathic pain. However, elucidating this microglia-neuronal signalling pathway was based on studies using only male rodents. Recent evidence has shown that the role of microglia in pain is sexually dimorphic. Despite similar microglia proliferation in the dorsal horn in both sexes, females do not upregulate P2X4Rs and use a microglia-independent pathway to mediate pain hypersensitivity. Instead, adaptive immune cells, possibly T cells, may mediate pain hypersensitivity in female mice. This profound sex difference highlights the importance of including subjects of both sexes in preclinical pain research.Pain is a quite frequent complaint accompanying numerous pathologies. Among these pathological cases, numerous neuropathies are retrieved with identified etiologies (chemotherapies, diabetes, surgeriesâ¦) and also more diffuse syndromes such as fibromyalgia. More broadly, pain is one of the first consequences of most inherited diseases. Despite its importance for the quality of life, current pain management is limited to drugs that are either old or with a limited efficacy or that possess a bad risk benefit ratio. As no new pharmacological concept has led to new analgesics in the last decades, the discovery of new medications is needed, and to this aim, the identification of new druggable targets in pain transmission is a first step. Therefore, studies of ion channels in pain pathways are extremely active. This is particularly true with ion channels in peripheral sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia known how to express unique sets of these channels. Moreover, both spinal and supraspinal levels are clearly important in pain modulation. Among these ion channels, we and others revealed the important role of low voltage-gated calcium channels in cellular excitability in different steps of the pain pathways. These channels, by being activated nearby resting membrane potential, have biophysical characteristics suited to facilitate action potential generation and rhythmicity. In this review, we will present the current knowledge on the role of these channels in the perception and modulation of pain.PMID: 26785150  [PubMed - in process]OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the medical history of the pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients to determine preexisting conditions that may relate to a later OHCA. METHODS: The study was a retrospective population-based cohort study in Helsinki (population 595,000) served by a single emergency medical service (EMS) system. All OHCA patients aged between 0 and 17 met by the local EMS from 2002 to 2011 were included. Medical records of the Helsinki University Hospital and its clinics were examined to find preexisting medical or surgical conditions. RESULTS: Forty-three patients experienced an EMS-treated OHCA. The annual incidence of an EMS-treated OHCA was 4.4 per 100,000 population younger than the age of 18 years. The mean age of patients was 7.9 years, largest age groups being younger than 1 year (30.2%) and 17 years (23.2%). The leading cause of OHCA was trauma (30.2%) followed by sudden infant death syndrome (18.6%) and cardiac reasons (14.0%). Nine patients (20.9%) survived to hospital, and 5 (11.6%) were discharged alive. Of the 43 patients, 28 (65.1%) had prior medical records in Helsinki University Hospital considering suspected or diagnosed chronic or otherwise significant conditions. The most common conditions were perinatal adaptation abnormalities (20.9%), psychiatric treatment (16.3%), and epilepsy (13.9%). Five patients had previous cardiac conditions. Trauma as a cause of OHCA was frequently represented among patients with prior psychiatric diagnosis or treatment. Among 17-year-old OHCA patients, 5 of 10 had psychiatric records. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the patients had prior medical records. Psychiatric disorders were strongly presented.We report the case of a 16-year-old healthy adolescent male who presented to the local emergency department with altered mental status. En route to a tertiary care facility, he began to decompensate and was found to be markedly acidotic. Further investigation revealed an elevated anion gap, and physical examination showed only abdominal pain and decreased level of consciousness. A broad differential diagnosis was considered at the time of the patient's presentation at the tertiary care center including ingestion of a volatile alcohol, sepsis, and an abdominal catastrophe. Although fomepizole and emergent dialysis were being initiated, laboratory tests confirmed ethylene glycol poisoning. This case demonstrates the importance of early recognition of potential ingestions in patients with altered mental status and supportive laboratory findings.We report on a young adult female presenting with altered mental status and chest pain. Timely review of her electronic medical record revealed a history of panhypopituitarism with poor medication adherence, although this was unknown at the time of her initial evaluation.The patient required hormone replacement and significant fluid resuscitation, followed by definitive treatment with a pericardiocentesis. She was discharged home on hospital day 4, with normalization of her diminished left ventricular ejection fraction at her 1-month follow-up.Although panhypopituitarism and cardiac tamponade are rare diagnoses, we highlight the management of severe hypothyroidism, the importance of early administration of hydrocortisone for panhypopituitarism, and the need for aggressive volume expansion to maintain preload in cardiac tamponade.BACKGROUND: Richter's hernia is defined as a type of hernia in which only part of the circumference of the antimesenteric border of a bowel wall is incarcerated within the hernia sac leading to ischemia, gangrene and perforation of the hollow viscus. Richter's hernia is known to cause strangulation without obstruction due to involvement of only a part of the circumference of a bowel wall. Inguino-labial Richter's hernia presenting with the complication of spontaneous entero-cutaneous fistula is rare. AIM: This is to report a case of spontaneous entero-labial fistula complicating Richters hernia occurring in an adult female. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old woman presented with a history of sudden generalized abdominal pain. She had a prior history left inguino-labial swelling of six years duration, which was initially reducible but became irreducible two weeks prior to presentation. There was associated discharge from the swelling a few days later. She was pale and febrile. Her temperature was 39.2Â°C, pulse rate was 110 per minute and blood pressure was 130/60mmHg. A diagnosis of left inguinolabial hernia was made. She was resuscitated and an exploration of the groin swelling was made. A rupture of the anti-mesenteric border of the ileum with strangulated preperitoneal fat was found. She had resection and anastomosis of the ileum. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous faecal fistula in inguinal region following rupture of strangulated Richter's hernia especially in adults is uncommon and can occur even in absence of obstructive symptoms. In presentation of any groin swelling, there is need for an early accurate diagnosis followed by prompt treatment. The delay in its diagnosis and management may result in this rare complication of spontaneous faecal fistula. This reflects the state of health care in the developing world and needs to be addressed by the concerned authorities.INTRODUCTION: Today, the diagnosis of SA is usually not considered as the etiology for right lower quadrant pain in patient with history of appendectomy, resulting in delaying making the correct diagnosis and treatment. Obviously, other more common causes should be excluded first. DISCUSSION: Stump appendicitis (SA) was first described by Rose in 1945. The commonest presenting symptom are abdominal pain (right lower quadrant pain 59%, non specific abdominal pain 16%, and central abdominal pain radiating to the right lower quadrant 14%). PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 54-year-old appendectomized woman presented with recent history of abdominal pain with periumbilical pain radiating to the right side and in the right iliac fossa, in the absence of fever, vomiting or other symptoms. Elective colonoscopy revealed appendicular orifice clogged by big fecalith, with hyperemic surrounding mucosa and CT confirmed "stump appendicitis". After 30 days of therapy with metronidazole 500mg/day and mesalazine 1000mgÃ2/day, the patient was submitted to surgery and appendectomy was performed, with a specimen of 24mm stump appendicitis. CONCLUSION: SA may well be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of acute right lower abdominal pain even in patients with history of appendicectomy.Long-term potentiation (LTP), a major cellular correlate of memory storage, depends on activation of the ERK/MAPK signalling pathway, but the cell type-specific localization of activated MAPKs remains unknown. We found that in the CA1 field of the hippocampus, shortly after LTP induction, an increase in the number of MAPK-positive cells occurred specifically among astrocytes of the stratum radiatum, suggesting a putative role of astrocytes for LTP. Desipramine (DMI) is an antidepressant which is used to treat major depressive disorder, but also other pathologies such as neuropathic pain or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Trycyclic antidepressants such as DMI may cause memory impairment as a side effect. However, biological underpinnings of this effect still remain unclear. Here, we show that DMI inhibited the astrocytic MAPK activation and thereby hindered synaptic potentiation. These effects correlated with a reduced neuronal activation in the stratum pyramidale, thereby prompting us to analyse a regulator of LTP located at the astrocyte-neuron interface in the stratum radiatum, namely the ephrinA3/EphA4 signalling pathway. DMI enhanced EphA4 clustering, which favoured an increased ephrinA3-mediated EphA4 phosphorylation and elevated EphA4 forward signalling. The co-administration of DMI with the Src inhibitor SU6656, which blocks EphA4 forward signalling, could partially reverse the LTP attenuation, further supporting the targeting of the ephrinA3/EphA4 pathway by DMI. Thus, our findings suggest a putative novel mechanism for DMI to modulate LTP through the regulation of the ephrinA3/EphA4 signalling pathway. A further exploration of the molecular and behavioral consequences of targeting ephrinA3/EphA4 might help to improve the clinical use of DMI.CONTEXT: Zaltoprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has potent inhibitory action against nociceptive responses. However, gastrointestinal ulcer accompanied with anemia due to the bleeding are most cited side effects associated with it. Due to this, administration of Zaltoprofen is not suitable for individuals with gastric ulcer. Thus, there is unmet need to develop an alternative delivery system that will be easy to administer and can avoid ulcerogenic side effects associated with it. OBJECTIVE: Present study was aimed to prepare and evaluate microemulsion (ME) and microemulsion-based gel formulation of Zaltoprofen for transdermal delivery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were utilized to prepare ME formulations. Effect of surfactant and co-surfactant mass ratio on the ME formation and permeation of ME were evaluated and formulation was optimized. Permeation studies were performed using excised pigskin was studied. Efficacy of optimized formulations was evaluated in rat model of inflammation and pain. RESULTS: Composition of optimized formulation was 1% (w/w) Zaltoprofen, 20% (w/w) Capryol 90, 50% (w/w) Smix (2:1, Cremophor RH 40 and Transcutol P). Optimized formulation showed globule size of 22.11ânm, polydispersity index of 0.251 and zeta potential of -11.4 mV. ME gel was found safe in skin irritation study. Significant analgesic activity and anti-inflammatory activity of ME gel was observed in hot plate test and rat paw edema test, respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, results of present study suggest that ME could be a promising formulation for transdermal administration of Zaltoprofen.High strength extended release opioid products, which are indispensable tools in the management of pain, are associated with serious risks of unintentional and potentially fatal overdose, as well as of misuse and abuse that might lead to addiction. The issue of drug abuse becomes increasingly prominent when the dosage forms can be readily manipulated to release a high amount of opioid or to extract the drug in certain products or solvents. One approach to deter opioid drug abuse is by providing novel abuse deterrent formulations (ADF), with properties that may be viewed as barriers to abuse of the product. However, unlike regular extended release formulations, assessment of ADF technologies are challenging, in part due to the great variety of formulation designs available to achieve deterrence of abuse by oral, parenteral, nasal and respiratory routes. With limited prior history or literature information, and lack of compendial standards, evaluation and regulatory approval of these novel drug products become increasingly difficult. The present article describes a risk-based standardized in-vitro approach that can be utilized in general evaluation of abuse deterrent features for all ADF products.The most serious complication of renal biopsy is vascular damage with subsequent haemorrhage. To our knowledge, we present a first ever case of lumbar artery (LA) rupture accompanied by massive retroperitoneal bleeding, which developed after a significant amount of time following the biopsy itself. In a 63-year-old Caucasian female patient, a percutaneous left kidney biopsy was performed under continuous ultrasound guidance. On the fourteenth day after the procedure, she was examined for a sudden onset of left lumbar region pain. Computed tomography angiography showed a large retroperitoneal hematoma with active bleeding from the fourth left LA. Successful endovascular superselective embolization was performed immediately. The predisposing factor for the late haemorrhage could have been anticoagulation therapy, renal insufficiency and older age. Our case report highlights the need for caution, especially when performing kidney biopsy in a group of high-risk patients, particularly if they are indicated for subsequent anticoagulant therapy.OBJECTIVE: We examined the dose-response relationship between weight reduction and pain/functional improvement in persons with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (KOA) participating in a community-based weight loss program. METHODS: Consecutive participants with KOA enrolled in the 18-week "Osteoarthritis Healthy Weight for Life" weight loss program were selected. In this completer's type analysis, participants were assessed at baseline, 6 and 18 weeks for body weight and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales. The dose-response relationship between weight-change categories (>10%, 7.6-10%, 5.1-7.5%, 2.6-5.0% and <2.5% of body weight loss) and change in KOOS scores was assessed by repeated measures ANOVA controlling for gender and age, body mass index (BMI), and KOOS. The Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) function score derived from the KOOS was used to assess a meaningful clinical functional improvement. RESULTS: 1383 (71% females) persons were enrolled. Mean (SD) age, height and weight was 64 (8.7) years, 1.66 (0.09)m and 95.1 (17.2)kg respectively. Mean BMI was 34.4 (5.2) with 82% of participants obese at baseline. 1304 (94%) achieved a >2.5% reduction in body weight. There was a significant dose-response relationship between all KOOS subscales and percentage of weight change across all weight change categories. Participants required â¥7.7% (95% CI 5.2-13.3) body weight loss to achieve a minimal clinically important improvement in function. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant dose-response relationship between percentage weight loss and symptomatic improvement. This study confirms the feasibility of weight loss as a therapeutic intervention in KOA in a community-based setting. This article is protected by copyright.

This article describes a series of pediatric oncology patients who received lidocaine infusions for refractory, longstanding, cancer-related pain. PROCEDURE: This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent lidocaine infusions to manage severe, opioid-refractory, cancer-related pain. Four patients ranging in age from 8 to 18 years were admitted to a pediatric hospital for their medical conditions and/or pain management. Structured chart review established demographic and diagnosis information, infusion rates, side effects, and efficacy of infusions in providing pain relief. Lidocaine bolus doses, infusion rates, serum concentrations, and subjective pain scores were analyzed. RESULTS: Median pain scores prior to lidocaine infusions were 8/10, falling to 2/10 at the infusion termination (P < 0.003), and rising to 3/10 in the first 24 hr after lidocaine (P < 0.029 compared to preinfusion pain). The infusions were generally well tolerated, with few side effects noted. In most cases, the improvement in pain scores persisted beyond termination of the infusion. CONCLUSIONS: CLIs were a helpful adjuvant in the four cases presented and may be an effective therapy for a more diverse array of refractory cancer pain. The majority of patients experienced pain relief well beyond the metabolic elimination of the lidocaine, corroborating a modulation effect on pain windup. Additional research regarding infusion rates, serum concentrations, side effects, and outpatient follow-up in a larger group of patients will provide additional insight into the role and safety of this therapy in children.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of remaining pain in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after three months of treatment with methotrexate (MTX) as the only disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug, with special focus on patients with a good clinical response. METHODS: The study base was cases reported to a population-based early RA cohort (EIRA) who had follow-up data from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register (n=1241). The DAS28 EULAR response criteria were used to evaluate clinical response to treatment; good (GR), moderate (MR) and no response (NR). The primary endpoint was 'remaining pain' at the three months follow-up visit, defined as pain on a 100 mm visual analog scale above 20 mm (VAS pain >20 mm). RESULTS: Remaining pain in spite of EULAR good response at follow-up was associated with higher baseline disability (HAQ; adjusted OR 2.2, 95%CI=1.4-3.4 per unit increase) and less baseline inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR; adjusted OR 0.81; 95%CI=0.70-0.93 per 10 mm increase). Similar associations were detected for remaining pain at follow-up in spite of low inflammatory activity, defined as CRP<10. Increase in VAS pain during the treatment period was observed in 19% of the whole cohort, and with the frequencies in the EULAR response groups of 9% (GR), 15% (MR) and 45% (NR), respectively. CONCLUSION: These results are in line with the hypothesis that a subgroup of early RA patients exhibits pain that is not inflammatory mediated where alternative treatment strategies to traditional anti-inflammatory medications need to be considered.

RECENT FINDINGS: Rapid and adequate therapy of trauma-associated coagulopathy is crucial to survival of severely injured patients. Standard coagulation tests such as prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are commonly used, but these tests are inappropriate for monitoring and guiding therapy in trauma patients. Coagulation factor-based treatment showed promising results, but randomized trials have not yet been performed. In addition, viscoelastic tests are needed to guide therapy, although there is in fact limited evidence for these in tests in trauma care. Regarding transfusion therapy with allogenic blood products, plasma transfusion has been associated with improved survival in trauma patients following massive transfusion. In contrast, patients not requiring massive transfusion seem to be at risk for suffering complications with increasing volumes of plasma transfused. SUMMARY: The collective of trauma patients is heterogeneous. Despite the lack of evidence, there are strong arguments for individualized patient treatment with coagulation factors for some indications and to abstain from the use of fresh frozen plasma. In patients with severe trauma and major bleeding, plasma, platelets, and red blood cells should be considered to be administered at a ratio of 1â:â1â:â1.PURPOSE: Severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is still a significant clinical problem which is associated with a highly mortality. The aim of this study was the evaluation of prognostic value of CT regional perfusion measurement performed on the first day of onset of symptoms of AP, in assessing the risk of developing severe form of acute pancreatitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 79 patients with clinical symptoms and biochemical criteria indicative of acute pancreatitis (acute upper abdominal pain, elevated levels of serum amylase and lipase) underwent perfusion CT within 24 hours after onset of symptoms. The follow-up examinations were performed after 4-6 days to detect progression of the disease. Perfusion parameters were compared in 41 people who developed severe form of AP (pancreatic and/or peripancreatic tissue necrosis) with parameters in 38 consecutive patients in whom course of AP was mild. Blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time and permeability surface area product were calculated in the three anatomic pancreatic subdivisions (head, body and tail). At the same time the patient's clinical status was assessed by APACHE II score and laboratory parameters such as CRP, serum lipase and amylase, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP and bilirubin were compared. RESULTS: Statistical differences in the perfusion parameters between the group of patients with mild and severe AP were shown. Blood flow, blood volume and mean transit time were significantly lower and permeability surface area product was significantly higher in patients who develop severe acute pancreatitis and presence of pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis due to pancreatic ischemia. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of evaluated on admission severity of pancreatitis assessed using APACHE II score and laboratory tests. CONCLUSIONS: CT perfusion is a very useful indicator for prediction and selection patients in early stages of acute pancreatitis who are at risk of developing pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis already on the first day of the onset of symptoms and can be used for treatment planning and monitoring of therapy of acute pancreatitis. Early suspicion of possible pancreatic necrosis both on the basis of scores based on clinical status and laboratory tests have low predictive value.RATIONALE: Palliative care has focused largely on patients with cancer and yet patients with chronic lung diseases also suffer from high morbidity and mortality. The majority of deaths in intensive care units (ICUs) follow decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments, suggesting palliative care is critically important in this setting. OBJECTIVES: We explored differences in receipt of elements of palliative care for patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who die in ICUs compared to patients with cancer. METHODS: We identified patients with COPD, ILD, or metastatic cancer who died in the ICU in 15 Seattle-area hospitals between 2003 and 2008. We used robust multivariable logistic and linear regression to compare differences in receipt of elements of palliative care and length of stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared to patients with cancer, patients with COPD were more likely to experience CPR prior to death and patients with ILD were less likely to have documentation of pain assessment in the last day of life. Patients with ILD and COPD were less likely to have a DNR in place at time of death and less likely to have documentation of discussion about prognosis compared to patients with cancer. Patients with COPD had longer hospital lengths of stay, and patients with COPD and ILD had longer ICU lengths of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who die in the ICU, patients with ILD and COPD receive fewer elements of palliative care and have longer lengths of stay compared to patients with cancer. These findings identify areas for improvement in caring for patients with chronic lung diseases.Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) presents a unique therapeutic challenge. Fasciotomy, currently the most well accepted treatment approach, still has a significant number of treatment failures, demonstrating the need for additional options. Botulinum toxin has been introduced as a potential therapeutic agent, but long-term outcomes are unknown. We present the longest documented follow-up (14 months) of a CECS case treated with botulinum toxin injections. At 14 months follow-up, the patient reported continued pain relief and had resumed her active lifestyle without any adverse effects. Although more research is needed to optimize patient selection and treatment protocol, this case illustrates the potential for botulinum toxin as a long duration, low risk alternative treatment option for CECS.OBJECTIVES: Although there is a large body of research on the relationship between pain catastrophizing and functioning among individuals with chronic pain, little is known about the potential differential impact of specific aspects of pain catastrophizing. The current study evaluates the relationship between the rumination, helplessness, and magnification subscales of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and pain-related outcomes. METHODS: 844 patients who were admitted to a chronic pain rehabilitation program completed survey measures of pain, catastrophizing, quality of life, and depression. RESULTS: A series of analyses were conducted entering the three subscales simultaneously in a predictive model after pain intensity and demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, pain duration, current opioid use). The helplessness subscale accounted for unique variance in the prediction of pain severity, pain-related interference, mental and physical health-related quality of life, and depressed mood. Magnification was significantly related to physical and mental health-related quality of life and depressed mood. The rumination subscale was not uniquely associated with any of the outcome measures beyond that which was accounted for by pain severity, magnification, or helplessness. DISCUSSION: Pain catastrophizing is a multifaceted construct, and different domains of catastrophizing are uniquely related to pain-related outcomes. This study represents the first to evaluate the functioning of these subscales in a large, diagnostically heterogeneous sample of chronic pain patients.INTRODUCTION: Children born very preterm display altered pain thresholds. Little is known about neonatal clinical and psychosocial factors associated with their later pain perception. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine whether the number of neonatal invasive procedures, adjusted for other clinical and psychosocial factors, was associated with self-ratings of pain during a blood collection procedure in children born very preterm at school age. METHODS: 56 children born very preterm (24-32 wk gestational age) at age 7.5 years, followed longitudinally from birth, and free of major neurodevelopmental impairments, underwent a blood collection by venipuncture. The children's pain was self-reported using the Coloured Analog Scale and Facial Affective Scale. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Pain exposure (number of invasive procedures) and clinical factors from birth to term-equivalent age were obtained prospectively. Multiple linear regression was used to predict children's pain self-ratings from neonatal pain exposure after adjusting for neonatal clinical and concurrent psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Greater number of neonatal invasive procedures and higher parent trait-anxiety were associated with higher pain intensity ratings during venipuncture at age 7.5 years. Fewer surgeries and lower concurrent child externalizing behaviors were associated with higher pain intensity. CONCLUSION: In very preterm children, exposure to neonatal pain was related to altered pain self-ratings at school age, independent of other neonatal factors. Neonatal surgeries and concurrent psychosocial factors were also associated with pain ratings.OBJECTIVES: The 2013 clinical practice guidelines for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium in adult patients in the ICU suggest that pain be routinely assessed using a validated pain assessment tool. Currently available tools have only been evaluated in nondelirious critically ill patients, yet delirium can affect as many as 80% of ICU patients. The validated pain assessment tool adopted by our institution is the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool, and the objective of this study was to investigate the validity of this tool in patients with evidence of delirium. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Two ICUs within a Canadian tertiary healthcare center. PATIENTS: Forty consecutive adult patients deemed delirious on the day of enrollment using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial Critical Care Pain Observation Tool assessments were conducted simultaneously by study personnel and objective nurses at baseline and after nonpainful and painful stimuli. Subjective opinions about pain and objective physical variables (including mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) were collected at the same time points. Discriminant validity was described using paired t tests, whereas internal consistency was described using the Cronbach Î± statistic. Responsiveness of the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool was measured by effect size, and reliability was described as the agreement between raters. Comparisons between the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool and the subjective assessments and objective measurements were based on positive and negative percent agreement. Critical Care Pain Observation Tool demonstrated excellent discriminant validity as evidenced by a highly statistically and clinically significant change in mean Critical Care Pain Observation Tool scores between baseline and painful procedures (mean difference, 3.13 Â± 1.56; p < 0.001; Cohen D, 2.0). Interrater agreement was also excellent (Îº > 0.6), and scores between raters were highly correlated (r = 0.957). The Critical Care Pain Observation Tool possessed a high level of internal consistency (overall Cronbach Î±, 0.778). Percent agreement was found to be greater between the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool and the nurse's subjective opinion of the presence or absence of pain when compared with that between the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool and physiologic variables (80.5% vs 67.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Critical Care Pain Observation Tool is a valid pain assessment tool in noncomatose, delirious adult ICU patients who are unable to reliably self-report the presence or absence of pain.Supraglottic airway devices are routinely used for airway maintenance in elective surgical procedures where aspiration is not a significant risk and also as rescue devices in difficult airway management. Some devices now have features mitigating risk of aspiration, such as drain tubes or compartments to manage regurgitated content. Despite this, the use of these device may be associated with various complications including aspiration. This review highlights the types and incidence of these complications. They include regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents, compression of vascular structures, trauma, and nerve injury. The incidence of such complications is quite low, but as some carry with them a significant degree of morbidity the need to follow manufacturers' advice is underlined. The incidence of gastric content aspiration associated with the devices is estimated to be as low as 0.02% with perioperative regurgitation being significantly higher but underreported. Other serious, but extremely rare, complications include pharyngeal rupture, pneumomediastinum, mediastinitis, or arytenoid dislocation. Mild short-lasting adverse effects of the devices have significantly higher incidence than serious complications and involve postoperative sore throat, dysphagia, pain on swallowing, or hoarseness. Devices may have deleterious effect on cervical mucosa or vasculature depending on their cuff volume and pressure.A prospective double-blinded placebo controlled randomized study was conducted in our institute to compare the efficacy of oral Silodosin, an alpha 1 selective antagonist and Diclofenac in relieving pain after stent removal. All patients with unilateral stent placement following renal and ureteric stone endoscopic surgery were randomized into four groups: group A (Placebo), group B (Diclofenac), group C (Silodosin) and group D (combination of Diclofenac and Silodosin). Visual analogue score (VAS score) and other relevant parameters were assessed during OPD visit. Patients were handed over randomized drug envelope and asked to take the medications one hour before the stent removal. Patients were contacted 24Â h after stent removal and relevant parameters were recorded. The mean VAS scores were significantly decreased in Diclofenac (2.9), Silodosin (3.08) and combination group (2.85) when compared to placebo (4.20) (pÂ <Â 0.001). However there was no statistically significant difference in VAS scores between the treatment groups, i.e., group B, C and D (pÂ >Â 0.5). Analgesics requirement and severe pain rates were not significantly reduced (pÂ =Â 0.07, 0.35) in the three treatment groups when compared to placebo. Thus Silodosin and Diclofenac, both are effective in preventing pain after stent removal.Osseous scaphotrapezial coalition is one of the rarest forms of carpal coalition of the hand. Often discovered incidentally, pain and functional limitation have not been reported. Carpal coalitions occurring across the carpal rows are thought to occur as a result of some insult or congenital anomaly. Isolated scaphotrapezial coalition calls into question the traditional thinking that fusion between the proximal and distal carpal rows must be acquired or associated with congenital syndromes.A 29-year-old patient, suffering from DiGeorge syndrome, came to our attention with a history of persistent pain and patellar instability in the left knee after failure of arthroscopic lateral release and Elmslie-Trillat procedure. The patient was unable to walk without crutches and severely limited in daily living activities. Because of arthritic changes of the patellofemoral joint and the failure of previous surgeries it was decided to perform only an open lateral release and medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction using a biosynthetic ligament in order to obtain patellofemoral stability. At one year post-op range of motion (ROM) was 0-120 with a firm end point at medial patellar mobilization; patella was stable throughout the entire ROM. All the scores improved and she could be able to perform daily activity without sensation of instability. Bilateral patellar subluxation and systemic hyperlaxity are characteristics of syndromic patients and according to literature can be also present in DiGeorge syndrome. MPFL reconstruction with lateral release was demonstrated to be the correct solution in the treatment of patellar instability in this complex case. The choice of an artificial ligament to reconstruct the MPFL was useful in this specific patient with important tissue laxity due to her congenital syndrome.We aimed to examine systematically the available evidence on risk factors of low back pain (LBP) in athletes. We performed search without language restriction in PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CINAHL. Longitudinal studies that examined possible risk factors of LBP in athletes were included in this systematic review. Based on methodological quality of studies, a best-evidence synthesis was conducted. Seven longitudinal studies were included, four of which had high methodological quality. Results showed that previous LBP, decreased lumbar flexion, and decreased lumbar extension are positively associated with LBP. There was moderate evidence for hip flexor tightness and high body weight as a risk factor. We found insufficient evidence for association between forward bending, previous injury, and amount of training per week, active years, age, and sex with LBP. In conclusion this study would provide a list of risk factors for LBP in athletes, though it showed a strong evidence for only a few including decrease lumbar flexion or extension, previous LBP, and high body weight. This review indicated a high heterogeneity of study characteristics including assessed risk factors and statistical techniques might limit the quality of evidence.A 39-year-old female patient was presented with acute abdominal pain. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed extensive granulomas throughout the abdomen. Disseminated TB was suspected, but the biopsies were negative. Due to a high degree of suspicion, a urine antigen test was performed and was strongly positive for histoplasmosis.A 24-year-old male presented with abdominal pain, fever, and palpable splenomegaly. His differential count revealed myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and nucleated red cells. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. We describe here our center's diagnostic and treatment approach for this rare leukemia.BACKGROUND: Appropriate postoperative pain control following total knee arthroplasty is important in patient recovery. Adductor canal block (ACB) is a novel method to deliver anesthesia. There are currently no studies using bupivacaine liposome with ACB while also taking into account cost. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and cost of using bupivacaine liposome to ropivacaine pain ball (RPB) for postsurgical pain control in total knee replacement surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint is mean pain score. Secondary endpoints include opioid and nonopioid pain medication consumption and cost per patient case. METHODS: This was a retrospective, matched cohort study with data collected from electronic medical records from February 2013 to June 2014. Mean pain score was measured by the 11-point Visual Analogue Scale over a 72-hour period. Cost analysis was also done looking at medication, direct, indirect, and total cost per patient case. RESULTS: Mean pain score over the 72 hours was 3.24 in the bupivacaine liposome group compared with 3.83 in the RPB group (P < 0.001). Lower mean pain scores were found in the bupivacaine liposome group during the first 36-hour interval postsurgery (3.1 vs 4.0, respectively, P < 0.001). Mean total cost was $20,919.53 with bupivacaine liposome versus $22,574.17 with RPB (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Liposomal bupivacainedemonstrated statistically significant impact in pain control in the first 36 hours, but by the end of the 72-hour interval, it was comparable to RPB in postoperative pain management. Using bupivacaine liposome did provide direct and total cost savings compared with RPB.OBJECTIVE: Adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) may suffer from skeletal symptoms leading to functional disability. No data on their quality of life (QoL) have been reported so far. Our objectives were to evaluate the QoL and its determinants in XLH adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in XLH adults, who consulted for musculoskeletal symptoms between 2013 and 2014. We assessed their QoL using HAQ, RAPID3 and SF36, and analysed the variables associated with low QoL. We compared their QoL to that of patients affected with axial spondyloarthritis (ax-SpA) (paired on age and gender), a rheumatologic disorder with a known low QoL. RESULTS: Fifty-two XLH adults (37 women (71.1%); mean age 41.8Â±13.3 years) were included; 44 (84.6%) patients had an altered QoL. Increased age and presence of structural lesions were significantly associated with worse QoL (HAQ, RAPID3) (P<0.05). Presence of enthesopathies was significantly associated with worse RAPID3 (OR=4.45 (1.09-18.29), P=0.038). Treatment with phosphate supplements and vitamin D in XLH adults were significantly associated with a better SF36-mental component score (OR=0.14 (0.03-0.57), P=0.007 and OR=0.26 (0.07-0.98), P=0.047 respectively). QoL was significantly worse in XLH than in ax-SpA adults (VAS pain, SF36-PCS, RAPID3) (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study showed i) QoL of XLH adults is altered and significantly worse than that of ax-SpA patients (VAS pain, SF36-PCS and RAPID3), ii) structural lesions and especially enthesopathies are associated with a worse QoL and iii) treatment using phosphate supplements and/or vitamin D is associated with a better mental health score.Scurvy is a rare disease in developed countries. Risk groups include children with restricted diets, mainly patients who are autistic or have cerebral palsy. Furthermore, consumption of plant-based beverages has increased in recent years, especially in developed countries. When plant-based beverages are the exclusive diet in the first year of life and not consumed as a supplement to formula or breastfeeding, it can result in severe nutritional problems. We report a case of scurvy after exclusive intake of almond beverages and almond flour from 2.5 to 11.0 months of life. The patient was referred for pathologic fractures of the femur, irritability, and failure to thrive. He had typical radiologic signs of scurvy, such as osteopenia, cortical thinning, Wimberger ring, Frankel line, fracture, and periosteal reaction. Moreover, his plasmatic vitamin C level was very low. The child was diagnosed with scurvy and was started on vitamin C replacement therapy at a dose of 300 mg per day. Over the following 3 months, his general condition, the pain in the legs, and the radiologic features improved; the plasmatic vitamin C level was normalized; and the child started walking. In summary, this case demonstrates that scurvy is a new and severe complication of improper use of almond drinks in the first year of life. Manufacturers should indicate that these beverages are inappropriate for infants who consume a vitamin C-deficient diet.Opioid drugs may be used among older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for several reasons, including for chronic musculoskeletal pain, insomnia, and respiratory symptoms that are refractory to more traditional pharmacotherapy. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies show that opioids are being used in potentially concerning ways in the older adult COPD population. While there are clinical studies supporting the careful prescription of opioids to help treat refractory respiratory symptoms in advanced COPD, these trials have important limitations. Furthermore, the results of population-based observational studies raise several important safety concerns about the use of opioid drugs among individuals with COPD. Opioid drugs likely need to be used with more care than is presently the case among vulnerable older adults with COPD.BACKGROUND: Cellular therapies have shown encouraging results in the treatment of chronic osteoarthritis (OA). Herein, we present the final results of a phase I-II clinical trial assessing the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ex vivo expanded autologous bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC, XCEL-M-ALPHA), infused intra-articularly, in patients with knee OA. METHODS: Fifteen patients (median age=52years) with grade II(9) or III(6) gonarthrosis (Kellgren & Lawrence classification) and chronic pain were treated with an intra-articular infusion of 40.9Ã10(6)Â±0.4Ã10(6) MSCin a phase I-II prospective, open-label, single-dose, single-arm clinical trial. Endpoints were safety and tolerability. Efficacy was measured by the Visual Analogue Scale for pain, algofunctional Health Assessment Questionnaire, Quality of Life (QoL) SF-36 questionnaire, Lequesne functional index and WOMAC score. Cartilage integrity was assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and quantitative T2-mapping at 0, 6 and 12months. RESULTS: The cell-based product was well tolerated with few reported Adverse Events (mild arthralgia and low back pain). There was a relevant decrease in the intensity of pain since day 8 after the infusion, that was maintained after 12months. The SF-36 QoL test showed improvement of parameters including bodily pain, role physical and physical functioning at month 12. The health assessment questionnaire revealed a significant decrease of incapacity. Moreover, T2 mapping showed signs of cartilage regeneration in all patients at 12months post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Single intra-articular infusion of XCEL-M-ALPHA is a safe and well-tolerated cell-based product, associated with a long-lasting amelioration of pain, improvement of QoL (up to four years), and signs of cartilage repair.BACKGROUND: In December 2014 a patient presented to our clinic with the clinical symptoms of vasculitis. However, treatment with glucocorticoids did not lead to any improvement; therefore, the differential diagnostics were extended to other indications and ultimately led to the diagnosis of scurvy. OBJECTIVE: This article describes the clinical picture of scurvy and its relationship to rheumatic diseases based on a clinical case and additional information from the literature. Differences and similarities with important rheumatological disease symptoms are presented. RESULTS: Scurvy is a rare hypovitaminosis disease which can be manifested in different forms. In addition to vasculitis the symptoms can also resemble arthritis and hemarthrosis is a typical finding. These symptoms can be accompanied by unspecific manifestations, such as muscle pain and due to impaired collagen synthesis characteristic features, such as corkscrew hair can be observed. The causal therapy of scurvy is substitution of ascorbic acid. CONCLUSION: Scurvy is a rare differential diagnosis in the context of rheumatic diseases. The indications for scurvy can be a lack of response to immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs as well as individual symptoms, such as corkscrew hair.OBJECTIVES: A key clinical paradox in osteoarthritis (OA), a prevalent age-related joint disorder characterised by cartilage degeneration and debilitating pain, is that the severity of joint pain does not strictly correlate with radiographic and histological defects in joint tissues. Here, we determined whether protein kinase CÎ´ (PKCÎ´), a key mediator of cartilage degeneration, is critical to the mechanism by which OA develops from an asymptomatic joint-degenerative condition to a painful disease. METHODS: OA was induced in 10-week-old PKCÎ´ null (PKCÎ´(-/-)) and wild-type mice by destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM) followed by comprehensive examination of the histology, molecular pathways and knee-pain-related-behaviours in mice, and comparisons with human biopsies. RESULTS: In the DMM model, the loss of PKCÎ´ expression prevented cartilage degeneration but exacerbated OA-associated hyperalgesia. Cartilage preservation corresponded with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines and of cartilage-degrading enzymes in the joints of PKCÎ´-deficient DMM mice. Hyperalgesia was associated with stimulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) by fibroblast-like synovial cells and with increased synovial angiogenesis. Results from tissue specimens of patients with symptomatic OA strikingly resembled our findings from the OA animal model. In PKCÎ´ null mice, increases in sensory neuron distribution in knee OA synovium and activation of the NGF-tropomyosin receptor kinase (TrkA) axis in innervating dorsal root ganglia were highly correlated with knee OA hyperalgesia. CONCLUSIONS: Increased distribution of synovial sensory neurons in the joints, and augmentation of NGF/TrkA signalling, causes OA hyperalgesia independently of cartilage preservation.Aldehydes accumulate in inflammation, during myocardial infarction and have been associated with pain symptoms. One pathway of aldehyde detoxification is the conjugation with carnosine. A 3-methylpyridinium carnosine adduct from the reaction of carnosine and acrolein was characterized using extensive spectroscopic measurements. The adduct with urinary concentrations of 1.82âÂ±â0.68ânmol/mg of creatinine is one of the most abundant acrolein metabolites in urine and opens promising therapeutic strategies for carnosine.Enkephalins are efficient pain-relief drugs that bind to transmembrane opioid receptors. One key structural parameter that governs the pharmacological activity of these opioid peptides and is typically determined from condensed-phase structures is the distance between the aromatic rings of their Tyr and Phe residues. We use resonance energy transfer, detected by a combination of cold ion spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, to estimate the Tyr-Phe spacing for enkephalins in the gas phase. In contrast to the condensed-phase structures, these distances appear to differ substantially in enkephalins with different pharmacological efficiencies, suggesting that gas-phase structures might be a better pharmacophoric metric for ligand peptides.BACKGROUND: Low serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a hallmark of hypophosphatasia. However, the clinical significance and the underlying genetics of low ALP in unselected populations are unclear. METHODS: In order to clarify this issue, we performed a clinical, biochemical and genetic study of 42 individuals (age range 20-77yr) with unexplained low ALP levels. RESULTS: Nine had mild hyperphosphatemia and three had mild hypercalcemia. ALP levels were inversely correlated with serum calcium (r=-0.38, p=0.012), pyridoxal phosphate (PLP; r=-0.51, p=0.001) and urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA; r=-0.49, p=0.001). Although many subjects experienced minor complaints, such as mild musculoskeletal pain, none had major health problems. Mutations in ALPL were found in 21 subjects (50%), including six novel mutations. All but one, were heterozygous mutations. Missense mutations were the most common (present in 18 subjects; 86%) and the majority were predicted to have a damaging effect on protein activity. The presence of a mutated allele was associated with tooth loss (48% versus 12%; p=0.04), slightly lower levels of serum ALP (p=0.002), higher levels of PLP (p<0.0001) and PEA (p<0.0001), as well as mildly increased serum phosphate (p=0.03). Ten individuals (24%) had PLP levels above the reference range; all carried a mutated allele. CONCLUSION: One-half of adult individuals with unexplained low serum ALP carried an ALPL mutation. Although the associated clinical manifestations are usually mild, in approximately 50% of the cases, enzyme activity is low enough to cause substrate accumulation and may predispose to defects in calcified tissues.BACKGROUND: It is generally believed that radiological signs of lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD) are associated with increased pain and functional impairment as well as lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Our aim was to assess the association of the Modic and Pfirrmann grading scales with established outcome questionnaires and the timed-up-and-go (TUG) test. METHODS: In a prospective two-center study with patients scheduled for lumbar spine surgery, visual analogue scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, Roland-Morris Disability Index, Oswestry Disability Index and HRQoL, as determined by the Short-Form (SF)-12 and the Euro-Qol, were recorded. Functional mobility was measured with the TUG test. Modic type (MOD) and Pfirrmann grade (PFI) of the affected lumbar segment were assessed with preoperative imaging. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect size of the relationship between clinical and radiological findings. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-four patients (mean age 58.5, 119 (42Â %) females) were enrolled. None of the radiological grading scales were significantly associated with any of the subjective or objective clinical tests. There was a tendency for higher VAS back pain (3.48 vs. 4.14, pâ=â0.096) and lower SF-12 physical component scale (31.2 vs. 29.4, pâ=â0.065) in patients with high PFI (4-5) as compared to patients with low PFI (0-3). In the multivariate analysis, patients with MOD changes of the vertebral endplates were 100Â % as likely as patients without changes to show an impaired TUG test performance (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95Â % confidence interval (CI) 0.56-1.80, pâ=â0.982). Patients with high PFI were 145Â % as likely as those with low PFI to show an impaired TUG test performance (OR 1.45, 95Â % CI 0.79-2.66, pâ=â0.230). CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between established outcome questionnaires of symptom severity and two widely used radiological classifications in patients undergoing surgery for lumbar DDD.A 59-year-old previously healthy man with a 50-pack-year smoking history presented with rib pain 1âmonth after a mechanical fall. Physical examination revealed a 1.5âcm right cervical lymph node and a 0.9Ã0.9âcm scalp nodule. The patient had only noticed the scalp lesion a month prior to presentation. Chest X-ray revealed a 5.8Ã5.0âcm left infrahilar mass. CT angiography demonstrated extensive metastatic mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy as well as hepatic, right adrenal and brain lesions. Pathology from fine-needle aspiration of cervical lymph nodes and punch biopsy of the scalp lesion were consistent with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis. The patient underwent brain stereotactic radiosurgery and palliative radiation therapy. Unfortunately, he passed away 4âmonths after diagnosis. Malignancy (primary or secondary) should be considered by clinicians in the work up of patients with new skin lesions, particularly in those at high risk of cancer.A 33-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and hypertensive urgency. Physical examination revealed widespread arterial bruits and marked difference in blood pressure between the upper limbs. Vascular imaging showed widespread narrowing in multiple vascular territories. He met the established American College of Rheumatology criteria for Takayasu's arteritis. His resistant hypertension was considered to be a consequence of bilateral renal artery stenosis and he subsequently underwent sequential stenting of his renal arteries leading to improvement in blood pressure and reduction in the number of antihypertensive medications. Subsequent imaging revealed progression of aortic thrombus in the setting of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and persistently elevated antiphospholipid antibodies fulfilling diagnostic criteria for primary antiphospholipid syndrome, requiring initiation of immunosuppression and anticoagulation.PMID: 26782893  [PubMed - in process]The aim of the Impact d'une dÃ©marche QUAlitÃ© sur l'Ã©volution des pratiques et le dÃ©clin fonctionnel des RÃ©sidents en Ãtablissement d'hÃ©bergement pour personnes Ã¢gÃ©es dÃ©pendantes (IQUARE) study was to examine the effects of a global intervention comprising professional support and education for nursing home (NH) staff on quality indicators (QIs) and functional decline and emergency department (ED) transfers of residents. One hundred seventy-five NHs in France (a total of 6,275 residents randomly selected from NHs) volunteered and were enrolled in a nonrandomized controlled multicenter individually customize trial with 18-month follow-up. NHs were allocated to a quality audit and feedback intervention (control group: 90 NHs, 3,258 residents) or to the quality audit and feedback intervention plus collaborative work meetings between a hospital geriatrician and NH staff (experimental group: 85 NHs, 3,017 residents). At the NH level, prevalence of assessment of kidney function, cognitive function, risk of pressure ulcers, behavioral disturbances, depression, pain, weight measurement, and transfer to the ED were recorded. Ability to perform basic activities of daily living was assessed at the resident level. At baseline, NH QIs were generally low (with large standard deviations), and annual rate of transfer to the ED was high (~20%) and similar in both groups. The intervention had a significant positive effect on the prevalence of assessment of pressure ulcer risk, depression, pain, and prevalence of ED transfers. It had no significant effect on functional decline. Large-scale efforts to improve QIs involving collaboration between hospital and NH providers and based on audit and collaborative discussion are feasible and improve some aspects of quality of care in NHs.OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of pain and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-together and separately-on performance-based and self-reported mobility outcomes in older adults in primary care with mild to moderate self-reported mobility limitations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Academic community outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older in primary care enrolled in the Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study in the Elderly who were at risk of mobility decline (NÂ =Â 430). MEASUREMENTS: Participants with an average score greater than three on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) were defined as having pain. MCI was defined using age-adjusted scores on a neuropsychological battery. Multivariable linear regression models assessed associations between pain and MCI, together and separately, and mobility performance (habitual gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery), and self-reports of function and disability in various day-to-day activities (Late Life Function and Disability Instrument). RESULTS: The prevalence of pain was 34% and of MCI was 42%; 17% had pain only, 25% had MCI only, 17% had pain and MCI, and 41% had neither. Participants with pain and MCI performed significantly worse than all others on all mobility outcomes (PÂ <Â .001). Participants with MCI only or pain only also performed significantly worse on all mobility outcomes than those with neither (PÂ <Â .001). CONCLUSION: Mild to moderate pain and MCI were independently associated with poor mobility, and the presence of both comorbidities was associated with the poorest status. Primary care practitioners who encounter older adults in need of mobility rehabilitation should consider screening them for pain and MCI to better inform subsequent therapeutic interventions.PURPOSE: Poststernotomy mediastinitis (PSM), the severe chest wall and mediastinal infection that may arise at any time after a sternotomy, causes significant morbidity and mortality globally. Late recognition and diagnosis are the major contributors to a poor outcome. This review focuses on recent advances in diagnosing PSM (particularly after cardiovascular surgery) at the earliest opportunity-in the emergency department. RECENT FINDINGS: Morbidity and mortality of PSM, especially when associated with numerous other complications, remain unaltered high. Careful history taking and clinical examination remain the mainstays of a preliminary diagnosis. No specific signs are indicative of PSM alone. Procalcitonin as a biomarker and neutrophil volume distribution width obtained during a complete blood count with differential, assessed in the clinical context, offer interesting prospects of obtaining a speedy and accurate diagnosis. Adjunctive diagnostic imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography can differentiate PSM from postcardiac injury syndrome and other causes of vague chest pain some time after sternotomy with increasing accuracy. CONCLUSION: The speed and accuracy of diagnosing PSM have improved with recent advances in imaging and laboratory methodologies. In the symptomatic patient with a closed sternotomy wound or scar, with either fever (>38Â°C) or sternal instability, together with well-described signs on contrast-enhanced computed tomography, in whom other life-threatening causes of chest pain have been excluded, the diagnosis of PSM can be made without awaiting the outcome of microbiological confirmation. Nevertheless, there still remain significant research opportunities for clinicians and scientists to improve the early diagnostic accuracy of PSM.PMID: 26782792  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]OBJECTIVES: Patient compliance and satisfaction with analgesics prescribed after Emergency Department (ED) care for acute pain are poorly understood, largely because of the lack of direct patient follow-up with the ED provider. Our objective was to compare patient satisfaction with three analgesia regimens prescribed for post-ED care-a nasally administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), an opioid, or combination therapy-by collecting granular follow-up on analgesic use, pain scores, side effects, work activity levels, and overall satisfaction directly from patients. METHODS: We designed a prospective registry linking ED assessment and analgesic management for acute pain of specific musculoskeletal or visceral etiologies with self-reported automated telephonic follow-up daily for the four days post-ED discharge. Patients were prescribed a specific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID: SPRIX(Â®) , ketorolac tromethamine for nasal instillation) only, an oral opioid only, or both with the opioid clearly defined as rescue therapy, at the ED provider's discretion. RESULTS: There were 824 evaluable subjects. Maximum pain scores improved day-to-day more effectively with a ketorolac-based approach. Self-reported rates of return to work and work effectiveness were higher with SPRIX than with opioids or combination therapy. Adverse effects of nausea, constipation, drowsiness, and abdominal pain were higher each day among patients taking an opioid; nasal irritation was more common with SPRIX. Overall satisfaction at the end of the follow-up period was higher with SPRIX-based treatment than with opioid monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Automated telephonic follow-up of ED patients prescribed short-term analgesia is feasible. Ketorolac-based analgesia after an ED visit for many acute pain syndromes was associated with favorable patient outcomes and higher satisfaction than opioid-based therapy. SPRIX, an NSAID that is not available over-the-counter and has a novel delivery approach, may be useful for short-term post-ED outpatient analgesia. This article is protected by copyright.

Emodin, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is an effective monomer extracted from rhubarb and has been reported to exhibit antitumor activity in different manners in pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we examined whether emodin caused demethylation and increased the demethylation of three tumor-suppressor genes P16, RASSF1A and ppENK with a high degree of methylation in pancreatic cancer when combined with 5-Aza-CdR. Our research showed that emodin inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells in a dose-Â and time-dependent manner. Dot-blot results showed that emodin combined with 5-Aza-CdR significantly suppressed the expression of genome 5mC in PANC-1 cells. In order to verify the effect of methylation, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite genomic sequencing PCR (BSP) combined with TA were selected for the cloning and sequencing. Results of MSP and BSP confirmed that emodin caused faint demethylation, and 5-Aza-CdR had a certain degree of demethylation. When emodin was combined with 5-Aza-CdR, the demethylation was more significant. At the same time, fluorescent quantitative PCR and western blot analysis results confirmed that when emodin was combined with 5-Aza-CdR, the expression levels of P16, RASSF1A and ppENK were increased more significantly compared to either treatment alone. In contrast, the expression levels of DNA methyltransferaseÂ 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3a were more significantly reduced with the combination treatment than the control or either agent alone, further proving that emodin in combination with 5-Aza-CdR enhanced the demethylation effect of 5-Aza-CdR by reducing the expression of methyltransferases. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that emodin in combination with 5-Aza-CdR enhanced the demethylation by 5-Aza-CdR of tumor-suppressor genes p16, RASSF1A and ppENK by reducing the expression of methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3a.The use of public insurance is associated with diminished survival in cystic fibrosis patients following lung transplantation. No data exist on benefits of gaining private health insurance for post-transplant care among such patients previously using public insurance. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was used to identify first-time lung transplant recipients participating in Medicare or Medicaid, diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, and transplanted between 2005 and 2015. Survival outcomes were compared between recipients gaining private insurance after transplantation and those maintaining public coverage throughout follow-up. Since implementation of the lung allocation score, 575 adults with cystic fibrosis received lung transplantation funded by Medicare or Medicaid and contributed data on insurance status post-transplant. There were 128 (22%) patients who gained private insurance. Multivariable analysis of time-varying insurance status found no survival benefit of gaining private insurance (HR = 0.822; 95% CI = 0.525, 1.286; p = 0.390). Further analysis demonstrated that resuming public insurance coverage was detrimental, relative to gaining and keeping private insurance (HR = 2.315; 95% CI = 1.020, 5.258; p = 0.045).

METHODS: Thirty-five patients underwent oncological hybrid LESS either mini-laparoscopic-assisted LESS partial nephrectomy (LESS-PN, nÂ =Â 12) or mini-laparoscopic-assisted LESS radical nephrectomy (LESS-RN, nÂ =Â 23). Perioperative data were prospectively collected. The patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS) was used for the evaluation of the cosmetic outcome. RESULTS: Mean tumor size treated by LESS-PNs was 28.8 (IQR 20.5-37.3) mm. Average operative time and blood loss were 123 (IQR 112.5-145) min and 158.3 (IQR 100-200) ml, respectively. Renal artery clamping took place in seven cases. LESS-RN was performed in cases with a mean tumor size of 60 (IQR 48-71.5) mm. The average operative time was 116.8 (IQR 100-130) min. Average blood loss was 137 (IQR 100-150) ml. Complications were limited to grade II according to Clavien classification. The oncological outcome, including midterm results, was directly comparable to the literature. Patients reported low pain scores and high satisfaction in terms of postoperative scarring. The POSAS scores confirmed the excellent cosmetic outcome of hybrid LESS. CONCLUSION: The combination of mini-laparoscopic and LESS instrumentation as routine equipment of oncological surgery provided an efficient option for urologic surgery. The combination of mini-laparoscopic and LESS instruments improves the intraoperative ergonomics of LESS-PN and LESS-RN. The provided surgical and oncological outcome compares favorably to the LESS and conventional laparoscopic literature.Increasing numbers of patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) have been treated with focused-beam stereotactic radiation treatment (SRT) including Gamma knife, CyberKnife, X-knife, Novalis, or proton beam therapy. The purpose of this study was to document the incidence of tumor regrowth or symptoms that worsened or first developed following SRT and to discuss surgical strategies for patients who have failed SRT for VS. A consecutive series of 39 patients with SRT failed VS were surgically treated. Clinical symptoms, tumor regrowth at follow-up, intraoperative findings, and surgical outcome were evaluated. There were 15 males and 24 females with a mean age of 51.8Â years. Thirty-six patients (92.3Â %) demonstrated steady tumor growth after SRT. Two (5.1Â %) patients with slight increase of the mass underwent surgical resection because of development of unbearable facial pain. Symptoms that worsened or newly developed following SRT in this series were deafness (41Â %), dizziness (35.9Â %), facial numbness (25.6Â %), tinnitus (20.5Â %), facial nerve palsy (7.7Â %), and facial pain (7.7Â %). Intraoperative findings demonstrated fibrous changes of the tumor mass, cyst formation, and brownish-yellow or purple discoloration of the tumor capsule. Severe adhesions between the tumor capsule and cranial nerves, vessels, and the brainstem were observed in 69.2Â %. Additionally, the facial nerve was more fragile and irritable in all cases. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 33.3Â % of patients, near-total resection (NTR) in 35.9Â %, and subtotal resection (STR) in 30.8Â % of patients. New facial nerve palsy was seen in seven patients (19.4Â %) postoperatively. Our findings suggest that patients with VS who fail SRT with either tumor progression or worsening of clinical symptoms will have an increased rate of adhesions to the neurovascular structures and may have radiation-influenced neuromalacia. Salvage surgery of radiation-failed tumors is more difficult and will have a higher risk of postoperative complications. Radical total resection may not be feasible, and conservative modality of subtotal resection needs to be considered to avoid new neurologic deficits.BACKGROUND: The lifetime prevalence of women suffering from provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is estimated to be approximately 15%. The etiology of PVD is not yet clear. Recent studies approach PVD as a chronic multifactorial sexual pain disorder. PVD is associated with pain syndromes, genital infections, and mental disorders, which are common diseases in family practice. PVD, however, is not included in the International Classification of Primary Care. Hence, the vulvovaginal symptoms, which could be suggestive of PVD, are likely to be missed. AIM: To explore the relationship between specific vulvovaginal symptoms that could be suggestive of PVD (genital pain, painful intercourse, other symptoms/complaints related to the vagina/vulva), and related diseases such as pain syndromes, psychological symptom diagnoses, and genital infections in family practice. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all episodes from 1995 to 2008 in 784 women between 15 and 49 years were used to determine the posterior probability of a selected diagnosis in the presence of specific vulvovaginal symptoms suggestive of PVD expressed in an odds ratio. Selected comorbidities were pain syndromes (muscle pain, general weakness, irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]), psychological symptom diagnoses (anxiety, depression, insomnia), vulvovaginal candidiasis, and sexual and physical abuse. RESULTS: Women with symptoms suggestive of PVD were 4 to 7 times more likely to be diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis and 2 to 4 times more likely to be diagnosed with IBS. Some symptoms suggestive of PVD were 1 to 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with complaints of muscle pain, general weakness, insomnia, depressive disorder, and feeling anxious. CONCLUSION: Data from daily family practice showed a clear relationship between symptoms suggestive of PVD and the diagnoses of vulvovaginal candidiasis and IBS in premenopausal women. Possibly, family doctors make a diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis or IBS based only on clinical manifestations in many women in whom a diagnosis of PVD would be more appropriate.Microscopic polyangiitis is a small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and presents itself with glomerulonephritis and hemorrhagic pulmonary capillaritis. Peripheral nervous system involvement is common in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis, but brachial plexopathy is unusual. We present the case of a 22-year-old man with known microscopic polyangiitis who was under maintenance therapy with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide and developed cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis which increased in 6Â days accompanying pain and paresthesia in the upper limbs. His physical examination revealed hypoesthesia, absence of deep tendon reflexes, and decreased muscle strength in the upper limbs. His chest computed tomography scan showed ground glass pattern in the lower and middle lobes. Electromyography and nerve conduction study showed bilateral brachial plexopathy with involvement of all of the cervical roots that were more severe in the lower roots and left side.Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the growth of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterus. The disease affects approximately 10-15% of women of reproductive age and presents with clinical symptoms of pelvic pain and infertility. Changes in the leukocyte populations within the ectopic tissue and eutopic endometrium have been reported, and data suggest these alterations contribute to the pathology and symptoms of the disease. In this review, we discussed differences when comparing uterine NK cells and regulatory T cells within the eutopic endometrium between patients with endometriosis and healthy patients, and how these differences relate to implantation failure and/or decreased clearance of menstrual tissue in patients with the disease. The data demonstrate a critical need to examine endometrium and menstrual tissue in patients with endometriosis excluded from studies examining unknown causes of infertility and heavy menstrual bleeding. The information gathered from excluded patients will further enhance our understanding of how the immune system contributes to the pathophysiology of endometriosis and help to identify biomarkers for patients at higher risk for developing endometriosis-associated infertility.PURPOSES: To assess whether a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure is superior to limited thoracotomy (LT) for segmentectomy; postoperative pain was compared between VATS-lobectomy (VATS-L) and LT-segmentectomy (LT-S). Widely opened anterolateral thoracotomy segmentectomy (WT-S) was used as a control. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for 220 consecutive patients with stage I NSCLC treated between 2012 and 2015 at a single institute using VATS-L (nÂ =Â 58), LT-S (nÂ =Â 93), or WT-S (nÂ =Â 69). Pain scores from postoperative days (POD) 1-4 were measured using a visual analog scale three times a day. Chronic pain was assessed by the need for analgesics at 1, 2, and 3Â months postoperatively. RESULTS: No significant differences in pain from POD 1 to 4 were observed between VATS-L and LT-S, whereas WT-S showed significantly higher pain scores than these two procedures (pÂ =Â 0.0001-0.02). Chronic pain did not differ significantly among the procedures. CONCLUSION: Postoperative pain does not differ significantly between VATS-L and LT-S. LT may be preferable to VATS for segmentectomy to identify the anatomy, dissect the hilar nodes, and establish surgical margins.PMID: 26782289  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]BACKGROUND: The incisional hernia continues to be a frequent complication of laparotomies. The purpose of study is the analysis of hernia disease relapse after one year after different open plasties methods of the abdominal wall. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study was performed that included 142 patients. An analysis was performed on the individual data, the level of obesity, intra-surgical variations in intra-abdominal pressure, the intensity of post-surgical pain, the post-surgical complications, and the types of plasties of abdominal wall, simple and with polypropylene mesh. RESULTS: The analysis of studied group showed a general rate of relapse of 16.9%, and within the 4 procedures, 40.74% in the case of simple plasties, of 16.07% after the only plasties, 6.97% after the retro-muscular plasties, and 6.25% after the full substitution of parietal defect. On analysing the collected, hernia relapse was statistically significantly related to the level of obesity, variations in intra-abdominal pressure, post-surgical pain, and the type of procedure performed. CONCLUSIONS: Hernia is a frequent complication of laparotomies. Hernia relapse was more frequent in the case of simple plasties. Among the mesh procedures, the onlay plasty showed a higher rate of relapse and post-surgical complications. Hernia relapse was more frequent in the case of variations of intra-abdominal pressure, and with increased post-surgical pain. The use of an echography examination may increase the accuracy of the presence of hernia disease.The aim of the present study was to investigate whether changes in hepatic oxygenation can be detected by time-resolved spectroscopy (TRS) placed on the skin surface above the liver.METHODS: With approval of the local Hospital Ethics Committee and informed consent, six healthy volunteers aged 28.8 (25-36) years, and five patients with chronic renal failure aged 70.6 (58-81) years were studied. In six healthy volunteers, following echography, TRS (TRS-10, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu, Japan) probes consisting of a near-infrared light (at 760, 800, 835Â nm) emitter and a receiver optode, were placed 4Â cm apart on the abdominal skin surface above the liver or at least 10Â cm distant from the liver. In five patients with chronic renal failure, following echography, TRS probes were placed 4Â cm apart on the skin surface above the liver during hemodialysis (HD). RESULTS: In six healthy volunteers, the values of abdominal total hemoglobin concentration (tHb) were significantly higher in the liver area than in the other area (80.6âÂ±â26.81 vs 44.6âÂ±â23.1Â Î¼M, pâ=â0.0017), while the value of abdominal SO2 in the liver area was nearly the same as that in the other area (71.5âÂ±â3.6 vs 73.6âÂ±â4.6Â %, pâ=â0.19). The values of mean optical pathlength and scattering coefficient (Î¼'s) at 800Â nm in the liver area were significantly different from those in the other area (21.3âÂ±â4.9 vs 29.2âÂ±â5Â cm, pâ=â0.0004, and 7.97âÂ±â1.14 vs 9.02âÂ±â0.51Â cm(-1), pâ=â0.015). One of five patients with chronic renal failure complained of severe abdominal pain during HD, and abdominal SO2 decreased from 53 to 22Â %; however, pain relief occurred following cessation of HD, and SO2 recovered to the baseline level. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the optical properties of the liver may be measured by the TRS placed on the skin surface, and the hepatic oxygenation may act as a non-invasive monitoring for early detection of intestinal ischemia.The fabella is a sesamoid bone situated in the posterolateral knee, which may contribute to posterolateral knee pain by impinging on the adjacent common peroneal nerve (CPN). Although anatomic studies have established an relationship between the fabella and CPN, we present 4 cases of posterolateral knee pain radiating into the anterolateral leg in which sonography was able to determine the source of the pain as CPN compression by an adjacent fabella. In 2 of these cases, resolution of symptoms was achieved with ultrasound-guided CPN blocks, whereas 1 case was surgically treated, and another was managed with oral analgesics. These cases illustrate the utility of diagnostic and interventional sonography in the evaluation and treatment of posterolateral knee pain secondary to fabellar impingement of the CPN.Neuropathic pain is an incapacitating disease that affects a large number of people worldwide, but effective therapies have not yet been established. microRNAsÂ (miRs) are short non-coding RNAs that participate in several biological processes and states, including neuropathic pain. Nevertheless, the precise role of miRs in regulating neuropathic pain remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-218 in neuropathic pain using a rat model of chronic constriction injuryÂ (CCI). miR-218 expression was induced and studied in the spinal cord and microglial cells of rats with CCI. We noted that downregulation of miR-218 by a specific miR-218 inhibitor significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and proinflammatory cytokine release in CCI rats. A dual-luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR, and western blot analysis results demonstrated that miR-218 directly targeted the 3'-UTR of the suppressor of cytokine signalingÂ 3Â (SOCS3) and regulated mRNA and protein expression of SOCS3. Treatment with miR-218 inhibitors inactivated Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcriptionÂ 3Â (STAT3) signaling in rats with CCI inÂ vivo. Moreover, miR-218 inhibitors significantly inhibited the activation of microglial cell STAT3 signaling and downstream proinflammatory genes in microglial cells. These results suggest that miR-218 regulated neuropathic pain and neuroinflammation by regulating SOCS3 expression, which negatively mediated STAT3 signaling. Thus, we propose that silencing of miR-218 may be a promising and novel treatment for neuropathic pain.PURPOSE: Up to 50Â % of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors taking aromatase inhibitors (AIs) experience AI-associated arthralgias, or joint pain, which causes many to stop taking AIs and may inhibit exercise, despite known health benefits. We thus evaluated exercise adherence and factors associated with better exercise adherence in breast cancer survivors experiencing AI-induced arthralgia in the (HOPE) year long randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We included 61 HOPE women randomized to exercise (150Â min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and twice-weekly supervised strength training). Our main outcomes were aerobic exercise measured with daily activity logs, attendance at supervised exercise sessions, and changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, measured maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). We examined means and standard deviations (SDs) for exercise adherence by demographic and medical characteristics and used the t test for mean differences. We also examined predictors of adherence using linear regression. RESULTS: On average, at the end of the year long trial, women reported 119 (SD 78)âmin/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and participated in 70Â % of supervised exercise training sessions. After adjustment for other factors that influence adherence, at 6Â months postrandomization, only baseline VO2max was associated with higher aerobic exercise levels and at 12Â months, only older age predicted better supervised exercise training attendance. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survivors taking AIs and experiencing arthralgia are able to initiate and maintain a year long exercise program, regardless of other factors that influence activity levels. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Breast cancer survivors can exercise at levels that have been shown to improve AI-associated arthralgia.Our aim was to compare the single puncture technique for arthrocentesis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) with the double puncture technique and to evaluate the short-term effects of a single puncture. Forty patients were randomly divided into two groups: the first was treated by single puncture, and the second with double puncture, arthrocentesis. During the one-month follow-up period the visual analogue and verbal scales for pain, maximal mouth opening, and satisfaction were evaluated within each group and between the two groups. Both groups recorded significant improvements compared with the baseline values in almost all outcome variables. There were no significant differences between the groups. Arthrocentesis of the TMJ was successful with both techniques.The prevalence of hypertension in the general population has steadily climbed over the past several decades and hypertension is a primary or secondary diagnosis in nearly a fourth of hospitalized adults. Hospitalization is often a time of pertubation in a patient's usual blood pressure control, with pain, anxiety and missed medications all risk factors for severe hypertension. Hospitalists are often faced with severe hypertension in a patient not previously known to them and this presents a challenge of how best to assess the clinical importance of blood pressure elevation. An additional challenge is the lack of literature to guide the optimal management of hypertension in inpatients. This review aims to describe the scope of the problem, to describe the near and long-term risks of overzealous blood pressure management, and to identify areas for future study.Emerging evidence indicates that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is involved in chronic pain. However, few studies have systemically assessed its role in direct nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain and the underlying mechanism. Here, we determined that spared nerve injury (SNI) increased the expression of CXCL12 and its cognate receptor CXCR4 in lumbar 5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and satellite glial cells. SNI also induced long-lasting upregulation of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in the ipsilateral L4-5 spinal cord dorsal horn, characterized by CXCL12 expression in neurons and microglia, and CXCR4 expression in neurons and astrocytes. Moreover, SNI-induced a sustained increase in TNF-Î± expression in the DRG and spinal cord. Intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of the TNF-Î± synthesis inhibitor thalidomideÂ reduced the SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and inhibited the expression of CXCL12 in the DRG and spinal cord. Intrathecal injection (i.t.) of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, both 30Â min before and 7Â days after SNI, reduced the behavioral signs of allodynia. Rats given an i.t. or i.p. bolus of AMD3100 on day 8 of SNI exhibited attenuated abnormal pain behaviors. The neuropathic pain established following SNI was also impaired by i.t. administration of a CXCL12-neutralizing antibody. Moreover, repetitive i.t. AMD3100 administration prevented the activation of ERK in the spinal cord. The mechanical hypersensitivity induced in naÃ¯ve rats by i.t. CXCL12 was alleviated by pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Collectively, our results revealed that TNF-Î± might mediate the upregulation of CXCL12 in the DRG and spinal cord following SNI, and that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling via ERK activation contributes to the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain.The Î±2Î´-1 subunit of the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) is a molecular target of gabapentin (GBP), which has been used as a first-line drug for the relief of neuropathic pain. GBP exerts its anti-nociceptive effects by disrupting trafficking of the Î±2Î´-1 subunit to the presynaptic membrane, resulting in decreased neurotransmitter release. We previously showed that GBP has an anti-allodynic effect in the first two weeks; but this is followed by insensitivity in the later stage after repeated administration in a rat model of central post-stroke pain (CPSP) hypersensitivity induced by intra-thalamic hemorrhage. To explore the mechanisms underlying GBP insensitivity, the cellular localization and time-course of expression of the Î±2Î´-1 subunit in both the thalamus and spinal dorsal horn were studied in the same model. We found that the Î±2Î´-1 subunit was mostly localized in neurons, but not astrocytes and microglia. The level of Î±2Î´-1 protein increased in the first two weeks after injury but then decreased in the third week, when GBP insensitivity occurred. Furthermore, the Î±2Î´-1 down-regulation was likely caused by later neuronal loss in the injured thalamus through a mechanism other than apoptosis. In summary, the present results suggest that the GBP receptor Î±2Î´-1 is mainly expressed in thalamic neurons in which it is up-regulated in the early stage of CPSP but this is followed by dramatic down-regulation, which is likely associated with GBP insensitivity after long-term use.Several countries scaling-up adult medical male circumcision (MMC) for HIV prevention intend to introduce early infant male circumcision (EIMC). To assess preference for EIMC in a community with a mature adult MMC program, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of mothers (nÂ =Â 613) and fathers (nÂ =Â 430) of baby boys ("index son") at 16 health facilities in western Kenya. Most (59Â %) were for EIMC, generally. Just 29Â % were for circumcising the index son. Pain and protection from HIV were the most frequently cited barrier and facilitator to EIMC, respectively. In multivariable logistic regression, ever talking with the partner about EIMC and positive serostatus were associated with preference for EIMC for the index son. Attitudes towards EIMC are favorable. Willingness to circumcise an infant son is modest. To facilitate EIMC uptake, education about EIMC pain management and encouraging discussion between parents about EIMC during pregnancy should be integrated into programs.BACKGROUND: It is usually assumed that musculoskeletal pain is associated with both the physical workload and the psychosocial work environment, as well as with personal and lifestyle factors. This study aims to ascertain the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in women with varying or different occupational exposures, and to explore the associations between musculoskeletal pain and the occupational and personal factors. METHODS: A questionnaire on physical, psychosocial and individual factors was answered by 1591 women in five occupational groups with contrasting occupational exposures (teachers, anaesthetic, theatre, and assistant nurses, and sonographers). The outcome measure was musculoskeletal pain (in a new model based on frequency and intensity of complaints the preceding year) from the neck, shoulders, hands, lower back and feet. RESULTS: Neck pain was equally frequent among teachers, assistant nurses and sonographers, and less frequent in anaesthetic and theatre nurses. The sonographers experienced the highest prevalence of shoulder pain, while the assistant nurses were the most affected in the wrists and hands, lower back, and feet. The teachers reported the highest scores in most of the psychosocial dimensions. The theatre nurses scored highest in strenuous work postures and movements (mechanical exposure index, MEI), and the assistant nurses in physical activity and lifting (physical exposure index, PHYI). Multivariable models in the total population showed that both the physical workload and the psychosocial work environment were associated with pain in all body regions, though different factors affected different regions. Pain in the neck, shoulders, hands and lower back was strongly associated with a high MEI and high job demands, while pain in the feet was associated with a high PHYI and a high BMI. A young age was associated with pain in the neck, and an older age was associated with pain in the hands and feet. Lack of time for personal recovery was associated with pain in the shoulders and lower back. CONCLUSIONS: The occupational groups were affected differently and need different protective measures. For the teachers, the psychosocial work environment should be improved. The surgical staff and sonographers require measures to mitigate lifting and constrained postures.An interparietal hernia is defined as a hernia in which the hernial sac lies between the tissue layers comprising the abdominal wall. A strangulated interparietal inguinal hernia without an external bulge is a rare cause of an acute abdomen and difficult to diagnose preoperatively. We report a patient with a history of a right inguinal hernia who presented with abdominal pain without inguinal bulging. An interparietal (preperitoneal) inguinal hernia was diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic reduction and a transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair. This is the first case report of an interparietal inguinal hernia managed entirely laparoscopically. Although the laparoscopic approach is not considered standard treatment for strangulated intestinal obstruction, it may be worth considering, especially for patients with uncertain etiology, because of its decreased invasiveness compared to open exploration.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether non-pharmaceutical retail outlets are aboding to the current Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) national guidelines for over-the-counter (OTC) sales of aspirin and paracetamol. METHODS: Stages 1 and 2 of the study deployed eight and four medical students, respectively, to undertake a mystery shopper style investigation. Stage 1: eight medical students attempted to buy â¥96 tablets/capsules aspirin or paracetamol in one transaction in 62 shops. Stage 2: four medical students attempted to purchase 32 paracetamol 500âmg along with a 'flu remedy preparation also containing paracetamol, in 54 shops. RESULTS: Stage 1 data revealed that 58% and 57% retailers sold more than the MHRA guidelines recommended for paracetamol and aspirin, respectively. We observed that 23% and 28% retailers were willing to sell â¥96 tablets of paracetamol or aspirin with no questions asked. Stage 2 results showed that 57% retailers sold 32Ã500âmg paracetamol in conjunction with a paracetamol-containing 'flu preparation; while 98% shops sold 16Ãparacetamol 500âmg along with a paracetamol-containing 'flu remedy, with no questions asked of the shopper or advice given. DISCUSSION: MHRA national guidelines for OTC medicines sales appear to be poorly adhered to in non-pharmacy shops. Sales of aspirin and paracetamol OTC must be better regulated in the UK to ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality rates of deliberate and accidental overdoses.Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (TVNS) is a promising complementary method of pain relief. However, the neural networks associated with its analgesic effects are still to be elucidated. Therefore, we conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions, in a randomized order, with twenty healthy subjects who were exposed to experimental heat pain stimulation applied to the right forearm using a Contact Heat-Evoked Potential Stimulator. While in one session TVNS was administered bilaterally to the concha auriculae with maximal, non-painful intensity, the stimulation device was switched off in the other session (placebo condition). Pain thresholds were measured before and after each session. Heat stimulation elicited fMRI activation in cerebral pain processing regions. Activation magnitude in the secondary somatosensory cortex, posterior insula, anterior cingulate and caudate nucleus was associated with heat stimulation without TVNS. During TVNS, this association was only seen for the right anterior insula. TVNS decreased fMRI signals in the anterior cingulate cortex in comparison with the placebo condition; however, there was no relevant pain reducing effect over the group as a whole. In contrast, TVNS compared to the placebo condition showed an increased activation in the primary motor cortex, contralateral to the site of heat stimulation, and in the right amygdala. In conclusion, in the protocol used here, TVNS specifically modulated the cerebral response to heat pain, without having a direct effect on pain thresholds.OBJECTIVE: To define the association between time taken to present to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 1-year outcomes. We also determined whether particular patient characteristics are associated with delays in seeking care after symptom onset. METHODS: We collected data, which included a customised case report form to record symptom onset, on adult patients presenting with suspected ACS to two EDs in Australia and New Zealand. Such patients were followed up prospectively for 1âyear. The composite primary endpoint included death, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris treated with revascularisation or readmission with heart failure occurring after discharge but within 12âmonths after the index presentation. RESULTS: ACS was diagnosed at presentation in 420 (16.8%) of 2515 patients recruited. Cox regression was conducted to assess the relationship between presentation time and the rate of primary endpoints after controlling for age, ethnicity, prior angina, prior coronary artery bypass graft and index diagnosis. Middle (2-6âh) and late presenters (>6âh postsymptom onset) developed the primary endpoint at a rate 1.22 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.85) and 1.57 (1.07 to 2.31) times higher than early presenters. Patients with known risk factors and cardiovascular disease were more likely to present late to the ED. CONCLUSIONS: There is an independent association between time to presentation and 1-year cardiac outcomes following initial chest pain assessment for ED patients with possible cardiac chest pain in the Australian and New Zealand setting. This association occurred irrespective of the eventual diagnosis. Effective public health campaigns and other measures that facilitate early presentation with symptoms for patients with symptoms suggestive of ACS are justified and may improve prognosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12611001069943.INTRODUCTION: Massive gastrointestinal bleeding is an emergency that can sometimes require immediate surgery. We report the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of massive rectal bleeding due to Yersinia enterocolitica, requiring ileocecal resection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old North African woman was admitted to our emergency department for massive rectal bleeding. She had a history of an iron deficiency anemia of unknown cause, and diarrhea 2Â months before the admission. On admission to our emergency unit, she was in a state of hemodynamic collapse. An examination showed discolored conjunctivas, massive rectal bleeding with clots and no abdominal pain. The first medical treatment included the use of noradrenaline. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed and did not show any lesions. Computed tomography of her abdomen showed significant and hypervascular wall thickening of her terminal ileum suggestive of a tumor. Because her massive rectal bleeding worsened and her collapse persisted, an exploratory laparotomy and ileocecal resection were immediately performed on the patient. Histopathological analysis showed enteritis caused by Yersinia enterocolitica. Her outcome was favorable. CONCLUSION: Enteritis due to Yersinia enterocolitica can take a pseudotumoral form and mislead the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether differences in the osteochondral junction (OCJ) in two different age groups could be detected with ultrashort TE (UTE) MR imaging in vivo. METHODS: Ten healthy controls aged 20-30 (group 1) and ten patients aged 40-50 with knee pain but no evidence of osteoarthritis (OA) (group 2) underwent 3T MR imaging of the knee using a 2D UTE sequence. Evaluation of the presence/absence of a high signal intensity (SI) line at the medial/lateral tibial (MT/LT) OCJ was performed. Regions of interest (ROI) were created at the MT OCJ and LT OCJ. The peak OCJ SI ratio was calculated by measuring peak OCJ SI using averaged craniocaudal SI profiling, then dividing by the mean SI of a background ROI to standardize between studies. Groups were compared using Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: A high SI line was present in significantly more group 1 subjects at both MT (p<0.001) and LT (p=0.002). There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) in MT peak OCJ SI ratio between group 1 (meanÂ±SD=0.85Â±0.10) and group 2 (0.77Â±0.12). There was no significant difference (p=0.19) in LT peak OCJ SI ratio between group 1 (0.81Â±0.23) and group 2 (0.80Â±0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in the UTE MR characteristics of the OCJ were demonstrated between the two age groups. Advances in knowledge: Alterations in the UTE appearances of the tibial plateau OCJ in the older group with knee pain compared with a younger, healthy control cohort may reflect the very early stages of OA.BACKGROUND: The carpal scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone in young adults after a fall on an outstretched arm that results in acute dorsal flexion of the wrist. However, stress fractures of the scaphoid are relatively rare. To the best of our knowledge, we describe the first case in the literature of carpal scaphoid stress fracture in a tennis player. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old Japanese man who was an elite junior tennis player was referred to our hospital after radiography and computed tomography revealed a carpal scaphoid fracture. The patient presented with pain in the wrist joint and tenderness over the anatomical snuff-box with diffuse swelling and reduced active dorsal flexion and flexion of the right wrist. The patient was treated conservatively and resumed participation in competitive events 5 months after his initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, the scaphoid stress fracture had resulted from repetitive practicing of the attacking backhand high volley, which involved excessive dorsal flexion of the wrist. Although rare, scaphoid stress fractures must be considered in tennis players with chronic wrist pain.Garcinia plants have been traditionally used to treat inflammatory diseases, such as skin infections and pain, in many regions including SouthâEast Asia. Garcinia subelliptica, a plant of the Garcinia species widely distributed from Japan to Thailand, has been reported to contain components similar to other Garcinia plants that exhibit antiâinflammatory effects. The present study aimed to explore the antiâinflammatory effects of ethanol extracts of GarciniaÂ subelliptica (EGS) in macrophages, as there are no previous systemic studies that have investigated the effects of Garcinia subelliptica on inflammation. Nonâcytotoxic concentrations of EGS (â¤200Â Âµg/ml) were observed to reduce nitric oxide production by modulating iNOS expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)âstimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. The expression of cyclooxygenaseâ2, the enzyme responsible for the production of prostaglandin E2, was notably reduced by EGS. EGS treatment inhibited the production of proâinflammatory cytokines, including ILâ6 and ILâ1Î², however, not TNFâÎ±. Reduced production of inflammatory mediators by EGS was followed by reduced phosphorylation of câJun Nâterminal kinase (JNK) however, not of other mitogenâactivated protein kinases and nuclear factorâÎºB. These results indicate that EGS selectively inhibits the excessive production of inflammatory mediators in LPSâstimulated murine macrophages by reducing the activation of JNK, suggesting that EGS is a candidate for modulating severe inflammation.OBJECTIVES: CT is nowadays an examination routinely performed in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. However, there are several ways to assess gastro-intestinal tract, in particular colonic segments. Aim of this study is to compare enterography-CT (E-CT), performed after oral administration of polyethylene-glycol solution (PEG-CT) versus enterography-CT performed also with water enema via rectum (ECT-WE) in patients with CD. METHODS: We have studied 79 patients with CD undergone to enterography-CT (42 evaluated with PEG-CT and 37 with ECT-WE) who have performed a lower endoscopy within 15 days before CT. CT results concerning large bowel were compared with endoscopic findings. Intestinal distension, discomfort of the patients, sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy were evaluated. Pearson test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Degree of abdominal pain was significantly higher in patients underwent to ECT-WE compared to PEG-CT. Distension of the colon was significantly greater in patients studied with ECT-WE compared to those studied with PEG-CT. Values of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of PEG-CT and ECT-WE were respectively 77, 86.5 and 81%, and 89, 100 and 92% in comparison with endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CD, ECT-WE allows the evaluation of large bowel in addition to small bowel better than PEG-CT.INTRODUCTION: Bilateral proximal femoral fractures without trauma are very rare conditions. They have been reported in connection with osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, parathyroid disease, tumors, epileptic seizures, electroconvulsive therapy, and postirradiation. METHOD: We present a case of a 75-year-old man with bilateral hip fractures. No trauma, neurological, endocrinological disorder, or malignancy was reported in his history. He had a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and had been taking inhaled steroids (budesonide) 800Â Âµg per day for 10Â years. He was a heavy smoker with a smoking history of 120 packs/year. His complaints had initially started as pain on the left hip and groin and then had progressed to the right in 10Â days. Plain x-rays of the pelvis showed left femoral neck and right subtrochanteric femoral fractures. Fixation with proximal femoral nail of the right hip and partial arthroplasty of the left hip was performed on the following day after his admission. Pathological examination revealed osteoporosis in bone samples from both hips. RESULT: COPD and osteoporosis have some common risk factors. Smoking, decreased exercise capacity, inhaled, or oral steroid therapy may increase osteoporosis and risk of bone fractures by decreasing bone mineral density. Non-traumatic femoral fractures may occur in patients on long-term inhaled steroid treatment for chronic airway diseases such as asthma and COPD. CONCLUSION: History of COPD with corticosteroid use may be used as a diagnostic tool to identify patients having osteoporosis. Preventive measures can be performed by monitoring high-risk patients with bone mineral densitometry, WHO fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX tool), serum calcium, and vitamin D levels to prevent bone fractures. Treating those patients with the lowest effective dose of corticosteroids should be targeted.BACKGROUND: Patients with intermittent claudication (IC) tend to walk at a slower pace, have less lower leg muscle strength, and consume approximately 40% more oxygen during walking compared with healthy individuals. An unfavorable locomotion pattern has been suggested to explain this metabolic inefficiency. However, knowledge on gait patterns in IC is limited. Muscle activity patterns during walking measured using surface electromyography (EMG) have not been investigated in this patient population. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, gait pattern of patients newly diagnosed with IC and age-matched controls were evaluated using kinematic parameters and medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles activity patterns. The protocol included pain-free and painful (only IC patients) treadmill walking sessions. RESULTS: A total of 22 IC patients and 22 healthy control subjects were included. Patients walked 1.4Â km/h slower (3.2Â km/h vs 4.6Â km/h; PÂ < .001) than control subjects, coinciding with a 10% slower cadence (110 steps/min vs 122Â steps/min; PÂ < .001). The kinematic analysis resulted in a patient's ankle plantar flexion reduction of 45% during the propulsion phase, and ankle dorsal flexion reduction of 41% at initial contact. No additional kinematic changes were observed when claudication pain presented. Interestingly, kinematic differences did not influence the muscle activity duration during walking, because equal duration of muscle activity was found in IC patients and healthy controls. However, the amount of muscle activity in microvolts did significantly increase in IC patients when claudication pain presented (TA: Î23%; PÂ < .001; MG: Î54%; PÂ = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IC show significant kinematic changes during walking. These alterations did not affect EMG activity duration of MG and TA muscles. However, EMG amplitude of both muscles did significantly increase during painful walking in IC patients.A 79-year-old man on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) developed abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal fluid two days after colonoscopy that revealed multiple diverticula. The white blood cell count was 9,000 cells/Î¼L, C-reactive protein level was 6.86 mg/dL, and the white blood cell count of the peritoneal fluid was 7,800 cells/Î¼L, suggesting acute peritonitis. Empiric therapy consisting of cefazolin and ceftazidime slowly improved the patient's symptoms. The initial microbiological examination of the peritoneal fluid demonstrated Morganella morganii. He was changed from CAPD to hemodialysis. It is important to consider M. morganii peritonitis in patients with colonic diverticula.Acute myocardial infarction, hyperhomocysteinemia and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are rare in individuals under the age of 30 years. We herein report the case of a 27-year-old man who presented with intermittent chest pain, elevated homosysteine level, and PTB. The patient was treated successfully with a combination of medications and percutaneous coronary intervention. This uncommon case highlights that homocysteine, folate and B vitamins levels should be regularly evaluated, and that chest X-rays or thoracic computed tomography should be ordered routinely to exclude PTB in patients under the age of 30 years who present acute myocardial infarction and lack the traditional risk factors.A 78-year-old man who had been diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was admitted to our hospital with chest pain, cold sweating and nausea. An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram revealed an ST elevated acute lateral myocardial infarction. He underwent an immediate cardiac catheterization. An occluded left circumflex artery was detected by coronary angiography. Reperfusion was performed successfully by non-slip element balloon angioplasty alone, without stenting, to avoid prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy. In this report we discussed the management strategies of acute myocardial infarction in a patient with concomitant ITP.BACKGROUND: The different forms of lubrication are among the most simple, accessible, and economic techniques that have been implemented for improving the diagnostic performance of colonoscopy. AIM: To determine whether the use of oil improved the number of complete colonoscopies, facilitated the procedure, reduced pain, or improved the study's diagnostic performance, compared with the conventional lubrication technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy-five patients referred for colonoscopy were alternately allocated to receive treatment with the standard lubrication method with chlorhexidine gel (group 1) or lubrication with corn oil administered through the working channel (group II). The number of complete colonoscopies, the length of time needed to reach the cecum, the degree of difficulty estimated by the endoscopist and the assistant, the level of pain at the end of the study estimated by the patient, and the endoscopic findings were all determined. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients made up group I and 87 made up group II. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in relation to general characteristics, the number of complete colonoscopies (93 vs. 97%, respectively), the time needed to reach the cecum (8:00 vs. 8:41min, respectively), the level of pain at the end of the study, or the detection of polyps. The degree of difficulty was slightly lower in group II, but with no statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Lubrication with oil during colonoscopy did not improve the number of complete colonoscopies, did not facilitate the study, nor did it reduce pain or increase the diagnostic performance of the study, when compared with the conventional technique.OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) is generally considered a better option than open donor nephrectomy as it is associated with better cosmesis, less postoperative pain and faster recovery. Mini-incision donor Nephrectomy (MDN) has proven to be an effective and less invasive modification of classic open donor nephrectomy. Our aim was to compare the peri-operative outcomes and quality of life of donors following laparoscopic and mini-incision open donor nephrectomy. METHODS: One-hundred patients, underwent donor nephrectomy using laparoscopic approach (n=50) or open mini-incision approach (n=50) over a period of 18 months. Data was entered into a prospective database and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The mean operative (skin to skin) time for MDN, 53.9 minutes (range, 40-75 min), was significantly shorter than the 93.7 minutes (range, 75-140 min) for LDN. The laparoscopic donors had a longer hospital stay, warm ischemia time and higher operative and postoperative cost. There was no significant difference in the pain scores, graft function or quality of life between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: MDN compares well with the laparoscopic approach in terms of postoperative pain, graft function and quality of life of donors. Significantly less operative time along with the reduced cost makes it a better option in our predominantly lower BMI patient population. This article is protected by copyright.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine how PEMF affects gene expression of IVD cells in normal and inflammatory environments. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This was an in vitro human cell culture and microarray gene expression study. METHODS: Human annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were separately encapsulated in alginate beads and exposed to IL-1Î± (10 ng/mL) to stimulate the inflammatory environment associated with IVD degeneration and/or stimulated by PEMF for four hours daily for up to seven days. RNA was isolated from each treatment group and analyzed via microarray to assess IL-1Î±- and PEMF-induced changes in gene expression. The study was funded in part by Orthofix, Inc. (approximately $200,000) and authors James T. Ryaby and Eric I. Waldorff are Orthofix, Inc. employees. RESULTS: Although PEMF treatment did not completely inhibit the effects of IL-1Î±, PEMF treatment lessened the IL-1Î±-induced upregulation of genes expressed in degenerated IVDs. Consistent with our previous results, after 4 days PEMF tended to reduce IL-1Î±-associated gene expression of IL-6 (25%, p = 0.07) in NP cells and MMP13 (26%, p = 0.10) in AF cells. Additionally, PEMF treatment significantly diminished IL-1Î±-induced gene expression of IL-17A (33%, p = 0.01) and MMP2 (24%, p = 0.006) in NP cells and NFÎºB (11%, p = 0.04) in AF cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that IVD cells are responsive to PEMF and motivate future studies to determine whether PEMF may be helpful for patients with IVD degeneration.BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The study of Low Back Pain (LBP) is complex and the physical and psychological aspects, including kinesiophobia, should be considered. Several studies have investigated the relationship between kinesiophobia and functionality in patients with chronic LBP. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no studies have investigated the association between kinesiophobia and self-reported assessments of disability and physical performance in elderly patients with acute LBP. PURPOSE: To investigate the association between kinesiophobia with self-report and physical performance measures among the elderly with acute LBP. DESIGN: This was an observational, cross-sectional, ancillary study of the Back Complaints in the Elders study (BACE), a longitudinal observational epidemiological research project by an international consortium involving Brazil, the Netherlands and Australia. PATIENT SAMPLE: Sample selection was carried out by convenience. The study included women from the community aged 60 years old and older who presented with a new episode of LBP. Volunteers with severe diseases as well as visual, hearing and mobility losses, or cognitive dysfunction, were excluded. Four hundred fifty nine elderly women (mean age of 69.0 Â± 6.1 years) were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Kinesiophobia was evaluated by Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), subescale FABQ-Phys. Functionality was investigated by the Roland Morris questionnaire and the gait speed test. METHODS: Statistical analysis was performed using hierarchical linear regression model. Statistical significance was established at level of .05. RESULTS: The additional predictive value due to the inclusion of the FABQ-Phys was 0.1%, using the Roland-Morris score, and 0.2% for the gait speed test. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to investigate the association between the FABQ-Phys and functionality in elderly patients with acute LBP. The results provide preliminary evidence that kinesiophobia assessed by the FABQ-Phys cannot be generalized to disability.The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent, potentially disabling complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that reduces quality of life and is costly. Clinical manifestations include symptoms and signs such as leg pain and heaviness, edema, redness, telangiectasia, new varicose veins, hyperpigmentation, skin thickening and in severe cases, leg ulcers. The best way to prevent PTS is to prevent DVT with pharmacologic or mechanical thromboprophylaxis used in high risk patients and settings. In patients whose DVT is treated with a vitamin K antagonist, subtherapeutic INRs should be avoided. We do not suggest routine use of elastic compression stockings (ECS) after DVT to prevent PTS, but in patients with acute DVT-related leg swelling that is bothersome, a trial of ECS is reasonable. We suggest that selecting patients for catheter-directed thrombolytic techniques be done on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on patients with extensive thrombosis, recent symptoms onset, and low bleeding risk, who are seen at experienced hospital centers. For patients with established PTS, we suggest prescribing 20-30 mm Hg knee-length ECS to be worn daily. If ineffective, a stronger pressure stocking can be tried. We suggest that intermittent compression devices or pneumatic compression sleeve units be tried in patients with moderate-to-severe PTS whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with ECS alone. We suggest that a supervised exercise training program for 6 months or more is reasonable for PTS patients who can tolerate it. We suggest that management of post-thrombotic ulcers should involve a multidisciplinary approach. We briefly discuss upper extremity PTS and PTS in children.PURPOSE: The ability to objectively predict which emergency department patients are likely to have a ureteral stone may aid in cost-effectiveness and patient-centered diagnostic imaging decisions. We performed an external validation of the STONE score, a clinical prediction rule for the presence of uncomplicated ureteral stones in emergency department patients developed at Yale University School of Medicine. METHODS: Five hundred thirty-six (536) consecutive patients evaluated in an urban tertiary care emergency department for the possible diagnosis of ureteral stone were retrospectively reviewed. The STONE score uses five factors (gender, duration of pain, race, nausea/vomiting, erythrocytes on urine dipstick) to categorize patients into low, medium, and high probability of having a ureteral stone. The total STONE score risk is 0-13 and divided into three groups: low riskÂ =Â 0-5, moderate riskÂ =Â 6-9, and high riskÂ =Â 10-13. RESULTS: Of the 536 patients evaluated for suspected ureteral stone, 257 (47.8Â %) had a ureteral stone. Mean patient age was 45.9Â years (SD 16.3), and gender distribution was 43.9Â % female and 56.1Â % male. Distribution of STONE score risk was 24.1Â % low, 48.1Â % moderate, and 27.7Â % high. Diagnosis of ureteral stone by STONE score risk was 14Â % for low-risk group, 48.3Â % for moderate-risk group, and 75.8Â % for high-risk group. This distribution is consistent with internal validation at Yale University School of Medicine, where values were 8.3-9.2Â % for low risk, 51.3-51.6Â % for moderate risk, and 88.6-89.6Â % for high risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our study validates the use of the STONE clinical score to categorize patients as low, moderate, and high risk for ureteral stone. This could help guide development of clinical decision rules for diagnostic studies and imaging in the future.PURPOSE: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) in fractures is especially indicated in patients of advanced age, although the influence of age on functional outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and complication rate is unknown. We hypothesized that complication rate would decrease in the geriatric population because of their reduced activity, improving the perceived HRQoL. METHODS: Retrospective study of 42 patients with proximal humeral fractures treated with RSA, divided into two groups: <80Â years (<80y)(nâ=â16) and â¥80Â years (â¥80y)(nâ=â26). The assessment tools used were radiological images (functional outcome) with the Constant-Murley score(CMS); disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score; and HRQoL with the EQ-5D index. Mean follow-up time was 32.6Â months. RESULTS: Mean CMS adjusted for age and sex (R-CMS) was 68Â %âÂ±â29Â %. Patients in the â¥80y group had a lower total CMS, 33 vs 64 (pâ=â0.027). Mean active range of motion at 24Â months <80y/â¥80y was: forward flexion: 126Â°/110Â°; abduction: 117Â°/105Â°; external rotation: 22Â°/20Â°; and internal rotation: L3/sacrum. Mean EQ-VAS was 74âÂ±â16 in the <80y group, and 63âÂ±â12.6 in the â¥80y group. Mean DASH was 29.5âÂ±â9.2. The EQ-5D "self-care" item in the >80y group was the most affected. The "pain/discomfort" item was lower for the two age groups than for the reference population. There were 9.5Â % complications: one prosthesis dislocation, one periprosthetic fracture and two surgical wound haematoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that age is a critical factor for RSA success. Lower functional outcomes have been obtained in patients older than 80y, although the EQ-5D results in our sample were similar or even better than the referred population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by an excessive amount of bacteria in the small intestine and a constellation of symptoms that include bloating, pain, gas, and diarrhea. Although known for many decades, there is a lack of consensus and clarity regarding the natural history and methods for its diagnosis. Several tests have been proposed, including the glucose breath test, lactulose breath test, small intestinal aspiration and culture, and others. However, there is a lack of standardization of these tests and their interpretation. Treatment of SIBO remains empirical; generally, broad spectrum antibiotics are recommended for 2Â weeks (amoxicillin, rifaximin, ciprofloxacin, etc.) but evidence for their use is fair. Clearly, there is a strong need to develop a systematic approach for the management of SIBO and to perform multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of SIBO. In this review, we will discuss the current evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of SIBO, which includes (1) elimination/modification of the underlying causes, (2) induction of remission (antibiotics and elemental diet), and (3) maintenance of remission (promotility drugs, dietary modifications, repeat or cyclical antibiotics).STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the impact of various components on patient satisfaction scores SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Patient satisfaction has become an important component of quality assessments. However, with many of these sources collecting satisfaction data reluctant to disclose detailed information, little remains known about the potential determinants of patient satisfaction. METHODS: Two-hundred patients were contacted via phone within 3 weeks of new patient encounter with 11 spine providers. Standardized patient satisfaction phone survey consisting of 25 questions (1-10 rating scale) was administered. Questions inquired about scheduling, parking, office staff, teamwork, wait-time, radiology, provider interactions/behavior, treatment, and follow-up communication. Potential associations between these factors and three main outcome measures were investigated: 1) provider satisfaction, 2) overall clinic visit satisfaction, and 3) quality of care. RESULTS: Significant associations (pâ<â0.0001) with provider satisfaction, overall clinic visit satisfaction, and perceived overall quality of care were found with: appointment scheduling, parking, office staff, teamwork, wait time, radiology, provider interactions/behavior, treatment, and follow-up communication. Nurse-practitioner/resident involvement was positively associated with scores (pââ¤â0.03). A 'candy-man' effect was not noted, as pain medication prescribing did not play a significant role in satisfaction (pâ>â0.05).In multivariate regression analysis, explanation of medical condition/treatment (pâ=â0.002) and provider empathy (pâ=â0.04) were significantly associated with provider satisfaction scores, while amount of time spent with the provider was not. Conversely, teamwork of staff/provider and follow-up communication were significantly associated with both overall clinic visit satisfaction and quality of care (pââ¤â0.03), while provider behaviors or satisfaction were not. CONCLUSION: Satisfaction with the provider was associated with better explanations of the spine condition/treatment plan and provider empathy, but was not a significant factor in either overall clinic visit satisfaction or perceived quality of care. Patients' perception of teamwork between staff and providers along with reliable follow-up communication were found to be significant determinants of overall patient satisfaction and perceived qualify of care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.PMID: 26780524  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]The recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) known as filgrastim (Tevagrastim(Â®), Ratiograstim(Â®), Biograstim(Â®)) in Europe (approved in 2008) and tbo-filgrastim (Granix(Â®)) in the USA (approved in 2012; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Petach Tikva, Israel) is indicated to reduce the duration of severe neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. This article presents pooled clinical data for tbo-filgrastim compared with Neupogen(Â®) (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) as well as tbo-filgrastim post-marketing safety data. The safety and efficacy of tbo-filgrastim were evaluated in three phase III studies in 677 patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy and study drug (348 patients with breast cancer, 237 with lung cancer, 92 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma). In each study, the efficacy of tbo-filgrastim was similar to that of Neupogen. Overall, 633 (93.5Â %) patients receiving the study drug experienced 6093 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), most of which were related to chemotherapy. Adverse events related to the study drug (tbo-filgrastim or Neupogen) were experienced by 185 (27.3Â %) patients; 19 (2.8Â %) had severe drug-related AEs, 5 (0.7Â %) had drug-related serious AEs, and 6 (0.9Â %) discontinued the study due to drug-related AEs. Overall, the most common drug-related AEs were bone pain (7.1Â %), myalgia (4.0Â %), and asthenia (4.4Â %). The post-marketing safety profile of tbo-filgrastim was consistent with that observed during the clinical studies. The availability of tbo-filgrastim, a G-CSF with safety and efficacy comparable to those of Neupogen, provides physicians with an alternative treatment option for supportive care of patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.PURPOSE: The current study assessed the long-term safety of fentanyl sublingual spray for managing breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP). METHODS: This open-label, multicenter study enrolled both de novo and rollover patients who completed a double-blind, efficacy trial. Eligible patients were â¥18Â years of age and experiencing pain that was being managed with an around-the-clock opioid yet were experiencing â¤4 BTCP episodes daily and were opioid-tolerant (i.e., receiving â¥60Â mg/day oral morphine or an equivalent dose of another opioid for â¥1Â week). De novo patients initially entered a 21-day titration period to identify an effective dose of fentanyl sublingual spray (100-1600Â Î¼g), then entered a 90-day maintenance period. The incidence of adverse events (AEs), results of laboratory tests, vital sign assessments, and treatment satisfaction were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 269 patients (de novo, 179; rollover, 90) who entered the maintenance period, 163 (60.6Â %) completed the study; the primary reason for discontinuation was an AE (22.3Â %). Eighty percent of patients identified an effective dose of fentanyl sublingual spray (median dose, 600Â Î¼g). The most common AEs differed from the titration period (nausea (13Â %), vomiting (12Â %), and somnolence (10Â %)) to the maintenance period (malignant neoplasm progression (24Â %), vomiting (16Â %), and peripheral edema (12Â %)). Few changes in laboratory parameters and vital sign assessments were observed. Patients generally reported being more satisfied with fentanyl sublingual spray than with their previous BTCP treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term maintenance study demonstrated that fentanyl sublingual spray was generally safe and well tolerated for managing BTCP over a 90-day period.Pain related to cancer or treatment is a critical quality of life (QOL) issue for breast cancer survivors. In a prospective study of 375 breast cancer patients (enrolled during 2008-2014), we characterized the risk factors for adjuvant radiotherapy (RT)-associated pain. Pain score was assessed at pre- and post-RT as the mean of four pain severity items (i.e., pain at its worst, least, average, and now) from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) with 11-point numeric rating scale (0-10). Pain scores of 4-10 were considered clinically-relevant pain. The study consists of 58 non-Hispanic whites (NHW; 15%), 78 black or African Americans (AA; 21%), and 239 Hispanic whites (HW; 64%). Overall, the prevalence of clinically-relevant pain was 16% at pre-RT, 31% at post-RT, and 20% RT-associated increase. In univariate analysis, AA and HW had significantly higher pre- and post-RT pain compared to NHW. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, pre-RT pain was significantly associated with HW and obesity; post-RT pain was significantly associated with AA, HW, younger age, â¥2 comorbid conditions, above median hotspot volume receiving >105% prescribed dose, and pre-RT pain score >4. RT-associated pain was significantly associated with AA (odds ratio [OR]=3.27; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.09-9.82), younger age (OR=2.44, 95% CI=1.24-4.79), and 2 or >3 comorbid conditions (OR=3.06, 95%CI=1.32-7.08; OR=4.61, 95%CI=1.49-14.25, respectively). These risk factors may help to guide RT decision making process, such as hypo-fractionated RT schedule. Furthermore, effective pain management strategies are needed to improve QOL in breast cancer patients with clinically-relevant pain.B cell-activation factor (BAFF) is critical for B cell maturation. Inhibition of BAFF represents an appealing target for desensitization of sensitized end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. We conducted a Phase 2a, single-arm, open-label exploratory study investigating the effect of tabalumab (BAFF inhibitor) in patients with ESRD and calculated panel reactive antibodies (cPRAs) >50%. The treatment period duration was 24 weeks. Eighteen patients received tabalumab, at doses of 240-mg subcutaneous (SC) at Week 0 followed by 120-mg SC monthly for 5 additional months. Patients were followed for an additional 52 weeks. Immunopharmacologic effects were characterized through analysis of blood for HLA antibodies, BAFF concentrations, immunoglobulins, T and B cell subsets, as well as pre- and posttreatment tonsil and bone marrow biopsies. Significant reductions in cPRAs were observed at Weeks 16 (pâ=â0.043) and 36 (pâ=â0.004); however, absolute reductions were small (<5%). Expected pharmacologic changes in B cell subsets and immunoglobulin reductions were observed. Two tabalumab-related serious adverse events occurred (pneumonia, worsening of peripheral neuropathy), while the most common other adverse events were injection-site pain and hypotension. Three patients received matched deceased donor transplants during follow-up. Treatment with a BAFF inhibitor resulted in statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful reduction in the cPRA from baseline (NCT01200290, Clinicaltrials.gov).INTRODUCTION: Dens invaginatus (dens in dente) is a developmental malformation resulting from an invagination of enamel organ into the dental papilla, beginning at the crown and sometimes extending into the root before calcification occurs. Dilated odontome is the most extreme form of dens invaginatus and it is extremely rare in the posterior mandible. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 47 years old female patient with occasional episodes of diffuse pain and discomfort in the left posterior mandibular region. The extra-oral examination showed slight facial asymmetry. Panoramic and intra-oral X-rays show an intraosseous circular formation with radiopaque external limits and radiolucent interior. DISCUSSION: Computerized tomography scan reveals the bone integrity around the formation, as well as the independence of the neuro-vascular structures of the region. The most likely diagnostic option was dilated odontome. The enucleation procedure was carried out, and the fragments were sent to histopathological examination that revealed a diagnosis consistent with a dilated odontome. CONCLUSION: In this case, the conservative surgical approach after planning was effective and predictable in the treatment of the pathology and patient symptoms without major complications.PURPOSE: Gabapentin displays non-linear drug disposition, which complicates dosing for optimal therapeutic effect. Thus, the current study was performed to elucidate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) relationship of gabapentin's effect on mechanical hypersensitivity in a rat model of CFA-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia. METHODS: A semi-mechanistic population-based PKPD model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling, based on gabapentin plasma and brain extracellular fluid (ECF) time-concentration data and measurements of CFA-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia following administration of a range of gabapentin doses (oral and intravenous). RESULTS: The plasma/brain ECF concentration-time profiles of gabapentin were adequately described with a two-compartment plasma model with saturable intestinal absorption rate (K m â=â44.1Â mg/kg, V max â=â41.9Â mg/hâkg) and dose-dependent oral bioavailability linked to brain ECF concentration through a transit compartment. Brain ECF concentration was directly linked to a sigmoid E max function describing reversal of hyperalgesia (EC 50, plasma â=â16.7Â Î¼g/mL, EC 50, brain â=â3.3Â Î¼g/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed semi-mechanistic population-based PKPD model provides further knowledge into the understanding of gabapentin's non-linear pharmacokinetics and the link between plasma/brain disposition and anti-hyperalgesic effects. The model suggests that intestinal absorption is the primary source of non-linearity and that the investigated rat model provides reasonable predictions of clinically effective plasma concentrations for gabapentin.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ultrasound-guided techniques for pudendal nerve block have been described at the level of the ischial spine and transperineally. Theoretically, however, blockade of the pudendal nerve inside Alcock canal with a small local anesthetic volume would minimize the risk of sacral plexus blockade and would anesthetize all 3 branches of the pudendal nerve before they ramify in the ischioanal fossa. This technical report describes a new ultrasound-guided technique to block the pudendal nerve. The technique indicates an easy and effective roadmap to target the pudendal nerve inside the Alcock canal by following the margin of the hip bone sonographically along the greater sciatic notch, the ischial spine, and the lesser sciatic notch. METHODS: The technique was applied bilaterally in 3 patients with chronic perineal pain. The technique described was also used to locate the pudendal nerve within Alcock canal and inject dye bilaterally in 2 cadavers. RESULTS: Complete pinprick anesthesia was obtained in the pudendal territory of the perineum in all 3 patients. Pain was effectively alleviated or reduced in all patients with no affection of the sacral plexus nerve branches. In the 2 cadavers, all 4 pudendal nerves were successfully targeted and colored. CONCLUSIONS: This new technique is based on easily recognizable sonoanatomical patterns. It probably implies no risk of sacral plexus blockade, and the pudendal nerve is anesthetized before any branches ramify from the main trunk. This promising new technique must be validated in future clinical trials.BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is a public health concern associated with the pathogenesis of several chronic disorders, particularly in women. AIM: To evaluate serum vitamin D levels and its deficiency and risk factors among employed women in a sunny industrial city. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, serum vitamin D levels, biochemical and hematological factors were assessed in 382 healthy employed women. Demographic information was collected using a standard questionnaire and data was analyzed by SPSS software. RESULTS: The mean vitamin D serum level was 22 Â± 19.8 ng/ml. Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were 62 % and 12.94 %, respectively. Deficiency was more common among younger subjects (< 29 years old). 23.5 % of subjects had normal and 1.35 % had toxic levels of vitamin D. Maximum serum level was observed in part-time job employees (33 ng/ml), and the lowest in Media and Culture Organizations (15 ng/ml).Vitamin D deficiency was associated with the lack of sunlight exposure at home, and taking anti-hypertensive medications. The common symptoms in deficiency condition were history of hyperlipidemia, depression, weakness, fatigue, finger tingling, leg cramps, and body and muscle pain. Moreover, LDL-cholesterol serum levels were significantly higher in the vitamin D deficiency group, with a prevalence of 40 %. CONCLUSION: The symptoms of vitamin D deficiency including depression, weakness, fatigue, tingling, leg cramps and body and muscle pain have been observed in more than 90 % after recruitment and treatment. Therefore, for improving the health and productivity of employees, a routine monitoring system for vitamin D and the other factors should be put in place.Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that uses low amplitude direct currents to alter cortical excitability. With well-established safety and tolerability, tDCS has been found to have the potential to ameliorate symptoms such as depression and pain in a range of conditions as well as to enhance outcomes of cognitive and physical training. However, effects are cumulative, requiring treatments that can span weeks or months and frequent, repeated visits to the clinic. The cost in terms of time and travel is often prohibitive for many participants, and ultimately limits real-world access. Following guidelines for remote tDCS application, we propose a protocol that would allow remote (in-home) participation that uses specially-designed devices for supervised use with materials modified for patient use, and real-time monitoring through a telemedicine video conferencing platform. We have developed structured training procedures and clear, detailed instructional materials to allow for self- or proxy-administration while supervised remotely in real-time. The protocol is designed to have a series of checkpoints, addressing attendance and tolerability of the session, to be met in order to continue to the next step. The feasibility of this protocol was then piloted for clinical use in an open label study of remotely-supervised tDCS in multiple sclerosis (MS). This protocol can be widely used for clinical study of tDCS.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of age on pressure pain threshold (PPT) of cervico-facial muscles in healthy geriatric subjects and to investigate the role of gender and dominance on nociception. BACKGROUND: Musculo-skeletal pain is common in the elderly, but being subjective, it risks to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. A useful method for assessment of local pain is determining PPT through pressure algometry. Ageing process seems to increase PPTs, but reference values for the assessment of pain in geriatric subjects are lacking. METHODS: In this study, PPTs in temporal muscle, masseter, sternocleidomastoid, occipital and splenius capitis of 97 healthy elderly subjects were measured using Fischer algometer. Participants were divided by age in four classes (years 65-69; 70-74; 75-79; â¥80). RESULTS: Women had lower PPTs in all muscles compared with men. Comparing PPTs obtained from the right and the left side, no significant differences were recorded neither in men nor in women. When dividing subjects by age class and education, in both genders no significant differences were observed in PPTs among the groups, neither in the right nor in the left sides. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study reports reference PPT values for the cervico-facial muscles that can be applied to a population of healthy elderly subjects. After 65Â years of age, further ageing does not influence PPTs in cervico-facial muscles whereas female gender has lower PPTs.Small fiber neuropathies (SFNs) are a subgroup of sensory neuropathies that almost exclusively affect thinly myelinated A-delta or unmyelinated C-nerve fibers. Patients with SFN typically report acral burning pain, paresthesias, and dysesthesias, and sometimes itch manifesting particularly at toes and feet. Although neurological examination and standard neurophysiological assessment are normal to only marginally abnormal, special small nerve fiber tests may show functional, electrical, and morphological small fiber pathology. Interestingly, the application of small nerve fiber assessment tools has revealed similar findings also in other painful and nonpainful disorders, such as the complex regional pain syndrome, postherpetic neuralgia, or fibromyalgia syndrome. The diversity in clinical presentation, however, already implies that different pathophysiological mechanisms underlie small nerve fiber degeneration and regeneration in these disorders. This review aims at presenting current knowledge on small nerve fiber research and at intensifying the awareness for SFN vs small fiber pathology as a chance to learn about small nerve fiber pathophysiology.Among many mechanisms implicated in the development of neuropathic pain after nerve damage is a profound dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory controls, manifested by ongoing pain, mechanical hypersensitivity, and thermal hyperalgesia. In some respects, neuropathic pain can be considered a "disease" of the nervous system, with features in common with trauma-induced seizures. Indeed, first-line management involves anticonvulsant therapy. An alternative to pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain is an approach that reestablishes the inhibitory tone that is lost after nerve damage. To this end, we have transplanted embryonic cortical GABAergic precursor neurons into the spinal cord of nerve-injured mice. Using a combination of light and electron microscopic analyses, and also in vitro electrophysiological recordings from spinal cord slice preparations, we demonstrated remarkable integration of the transplants into the host, adult spinal cord. Most importantly, transplants produced a complete reversal of the hypersensitivity in a sciatic nerve injury model and in a paclitaxel-generated chemotherapy model of neuropathic pain. In related studies, we demonstrated that medial ganglionic eminence cell transplants are also effective in a chronic neuropathic itch model in which there is a significant loss of dorsal horn inhibitory interneurons. Most importantly, in contrast to systemic or intrathecal pharmacological therapies, adverse side effects are minimized when the inhibitory control, namely, Î³-aminobutyric acid release, occurs in a spinal cord circuit. These studies suggest that therapy targeted at repairing the GABAergic dysfunction is a viable and novel alternative to the management of neuropathic pain and itch, particularly those that are or become refractory to traditional pharmacotherapy.Pain greatly affects the quality of life of people worldwide. Despite their demonstrated efficacy, currently used opioid drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently associated with several adverse events. The identification of new therapeutic targets and the development of corresponding analgesics may represent novel approaches for effectively treating pain. SY0916 is a novel compound that was designed and synthesized by the Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. As demonstrated by the hot plate test, tail-flick test and the formalin test, SY0916 exerted strong peripheral and central antinociceptive effects. Western blot, immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results indicate that SY0916 induces its peripheral antinociceptive effect by suppressing the peripheral activity of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Moreover, its central antinociceptive effect might be mediated by the down-regulation of PGE2 and TNF-Î± expression and the inhibition of p-p38 and NF-ÎºB pathway signaling in glial cells. These findings demonstrate that SY0916 may serve as a promising analgesic candidate drug.JWH-250 and JWH-073 are two synthetic cannabinoid agonists with nanomolar affinity at CB1 and CB2 receptors. They are illegally marketed within "herbal blend" for theirs psychoactive effects greater than those produced by Cannabis. Recently, we analyzed an "herbal" preparation containing a mixture of both JWH-250 and JWH-073. The present study was aimed at investigating the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activity of JWH-250 and JWH-073 in male CD-1 mice. In vitro competition binding experiments performed on mouse and human CB1 and CB2 receptors revealed a nanomolar affinity and potency of the JWH-250 and JWH-073. In vivo studies showed that JWH-250 and JWH-073, administered separately, induced a marked hypothermia, increased pain threshold to both noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli, caused catalepsy, reduced motor activity, impaired sensorimotor responses (visual, acoustic and tactile), caused seizures, myoclonia, hyperreflexia and promote aggressiveness in mice. Moreover, microdialysis study in freely moving mice showed that systemic administration of JWH-250 and JWH-073 stimulated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in a dose-dependent manner. Behavioral, neurological and neurochemical effects were fully prevented by the selective CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist AM 251. Co-administration of ineffective doses of JWH-250 and JWH-073 impaired visual sensorimotor responses, improved mechanical pain threshold and stimulated mesolimbic DA transmission in mice, living unchanged all other behavioral and physiological parameters. For the first time the present study demonstrates the overall pharmacological effects induced by the administration of JWH-250 and JWH-073 in mice and it reveals their potentially synergistic action suggesting that co-administration of different synthetic cannabinoids may potentiate the detrimental effects of individual compounds increasing their dangerousness and abuse potential.PURPOSE: Pelvic organ cross sensitization is considered to contribute to overlapping symptoms in CPPS. Overexpression of NGF in the bladder is reportedly involved in the symptom development of BPS/IC patients. This study examined whether a reduction of overexpressed NGF in the bladder by intravesical treatment with liposome and OND conjugates ameliorates bladder hypersensitivity in a rat colitis model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult female rats were divided into; (a) a control group, (b) a colitis-OND group with intracolonic TNBS enema and intravesical liposomal-OND treatments, (c) a colitis-saline group with intracolonic TNBS and intravesical saline treatments, (d) a sham-OND group with intravesical liposomal-OND treatment without colitis and (e) a sham-saline group with intravesical saline treatment without colitis. Liposomes conjugated with NGF antisense OND or saline solution were instilled into the bladder, and 24 hours later, colitis was induced by TNBS enema. Effects of NGF antisense treatment were evaluated by pain behavior, cystometry, molecular analyses and immunohistochemistry 10 days after TNBS treatment. RESULTS: In colitis-OND rats, the NGF antisense treatment ameliorated pain behavior, and decreased a reduction in intercontraction intervals in response to acetic acid stimulation as well as NGF expression in the bladder mucosa, which were all enhanced in colitis-saline rats compared to sham rats. CONCLUSIONS: NGF overexpression in the bladder mucosa and bladder hypersensitivity induced after colitis were reduced by intravesical application of liposomal OND targeting NGF, suggesting that the local anti-NGF therapy could be effective for the treatment of bladder symptoms in CPPS.Herein we present a case of hypereosinophilic syndrome with a unique clinical presentation. A 32-year-old man was admitted because of fever, hemoptysis and chest pain. The main clinical features include hypereosinophilia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thrombocytopenia and recurrent bone cysts. The plain film of the left foot revealed dissolvent bone destruction. The histological findings of bone cysts include eosinophilic infiltration and tissue necrosis. According to the case history and literature, it is possible that hypereosinophilia itself may be a risk for thrombogenesis and the bone destruction.Background/Aims: Although colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)-related perforation is not uncommon, the factors affecting clinical outcomes after perforation have not been investigated. This study was designed to investigate the factors influencing the clinical course of ESD-related colon perforation. Methods: Forty-three patients with colorectal ESD-related perforation were evaluated. The perforations were classified as endoscopic or radiologic perforations. The patients' medical records and endoscopic pictures were analyzed. Results: The clinical outcomes were assessed by the duration of nil per os, intravenous antibiotics administration, and hospital stays, which were 2.7Â±1.5, 4.9Â±2.3, and 5.1Â±2.3 days, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that a larger tumor size, ESD failure, specific endoscopists, and abdominal pain were independently related to a poorer outcome. The time between perforation and clipping was 15.8Â±25.4 minutes in the endoscopic perforation group. The multivariate analysis of this group indicated that delayed clipping, specific endoscopists, and abdominal pain were independently associated with poorer outcomes. Conclusions: Tumor size, ESD failure, abdominal pain, and the endoscopist were factors that affected the clinical outcomes of patients with colorectal ESD-related perforation. The time between the perforation and clipping was an additional factor influencing the clinical course of endoscopic perforation. Decreasing this time period may improve outcomes.BACKGROUND: Metastatic bone lesion is a common syndrome of many cancer diseases in an advanced state. The major symptom is severe pain, spinal cord compression, and pathological fracture, associated with an obvious morbidity. Common treatments including systemic application of bisphosphonate drugs aim on pain reduction and on improving the quality of life of the patient. Particularly, patients with multiple metastatic lesions benefit from bone-targeting therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Agents utilizing beta-emitting radionuclides in routine clinical praxis are, for example, [(89)Sr]SrCl2 and [(153)Sm]Sm-EDTMP. No-carrier-added (n.c.a.) (177)Lu is remarkably suitable for an application in this scope. METHODS: Five 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane N,N',N'',N''-tetra-acetic acid (DOTA)- and DO2A-based bisphosphonates, including monomeric and dimeric structures and one 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid (NO2A) derivative, were synthesized and labelled with n.c.a. (177)Lu. Radio-TLC and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were successfully established for determining radiochemical yields and for quality control. Their binding to hydroxyapatite was measured in vitro. Ex vivo biodistribution experiments and dynamic in vivo single photon computed tomography (SPECT)/CT measurements were performed in healthy rats for 5Â min and 1Â h periods. Data on %ID/g or standard uptake value (SUV) for femur, blood, and soft-tissue organs were analyzed and compared with [(177)Lu]citrate. RESULTS: Radiolabelling yields for [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA and [(177)Lu]Lu-NO2A monomeric bisphosphonate complexes were >98Â % within 15Â min. The dimeric macrocyclic bisphosphonates showed a decelerated labelling kinetics, reaching a plateau after 30Â min of 60 to 90Â % radiolabelling yields. All (177)Lu-bisphosphonate complexes showed exclusive accumulation in the skeleton. Blood clearance and renal elimination were fast. SUV data (all for 1Â h p.i.) in the femur ranged from 3.34 to 5.67. The bone/blood ratios were between 3.6 and 135.6, correspondingly. (177)Lu-bisphosphonate dimers showed a slightly higher bone accumulation (SUVfemurâ=â4.48âÂ±â0.38 for [(177)Lu]Lu-DO2A(P(BP))2; SUVfemurâ=â5.41âÂ±â0.46 for [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA(M(BP))2) but a slower blood clearance (SUVbloodâ=â1.25âÂ±â0.09 for [(177)Lu]Lu-DO2A(P(BP))2; SUVbloodâ=â1.43âÂ±â0.32 for [(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA(M(BP))2). CONCLUSIONS: Lu-complexes of macrocyclic bisphosphonates might become options for the therapy of skeletal metastases in the near future, since they show high uptake in bone together with a very low soft-tissue accumulation.Presently, the gold standard for pain control in laboring patients is neuraxial blockade, which includes a spinal, epidural, or a combined spinal-epidural technique. In conjunction with neuraxial blockade or by itself, some of the other agents employed related to labor pain include opioids, non-opioids, nitrous oxide, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and distraction therapy. Alternative treatments include acupuncture, hypnotism, yoga, exercise during pregnancy, hydrotherapy, transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation, massage, and relaxation techniques. This review will focus on current updates and recent trends in labor pain management. Neuraxial management, pharmacotherapy, and newer alternative methods to mitigate labor pain are reviewed. Newer techniques in epidural analgesia include the dural puncture epidural technique, which needs further evaluation. There are limited published data on the use of acupuncture, hypnotism, yoga, exercise during pregnancy, hydrotherapy, transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation, massage, and relaxation techniques in the alleviation of labor pain. These alternative therapies maybe considered as an adjuvant as the analgesic efficiency is inferior to that provided by typical standard pharmacotherapy. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the role of immersion virtual reality in alleviating labor pain.Primary headache is a common malady that is often under-recognized and frequently inadequately managed in spite of the fact that it affects up to 95Â % of the population in a lifetime. Many forms of headache, including episodic tension and migraine headaches, if properly diagnosed, are reasonably amenable to treatment, but a smaller, though not insignificant, percent of the population suffer daily from a chronic, intractable form of headache that destroys one's productivity and quality of life. These patients are frequently seen in neurological practices at a point when treatment options are limited and largely ineffective. In the following review, we will discuss mechanisms drawn from recent studies that address the transition from acute to chronic pain that may apply to the transformation from episodic to chronic daily headaches which may offer opportunities for preempting headache transformation.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the randomized clinical trial was to compare the 2 years of clinical outcomes of a lightweight (Ultrapro) vs a heavyweight (Prolene) mesh for laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. BACKGROUND: Lightweight meshes reduce postoperative pain and stiffness in open anterior inguinal hernia repair. The discussion about a similar benefit for laparoscopic repair is ongoing, but concerns exist about higher recurrence rates. METHODS: Between March 2010 and October 2012, male patients who presented with a primary, reducible unilateral inguinal hernia who underwent day-case TEP repair were eligible. Outcome parameters included chronic pain, recurrence, foreign body feeling, and quality of life scores. RESULTS: During the study period, 950 patients were included. One year postoperatively the presence of relevant pain (Numeric Rating Score 4-10) was significantly higher in the lightweight mesh group (2.9%) compared with the heavyweight mesh group (0.7%) (P = 0.01), and after 2 years this difference remained significant (P = 0.03). There were 4 (0.8%) recurrent hernias in the heavyweight mesh group and 13 (2.7%) in the lightweight group (P = 0.03). No differences in foreign body feeling or quality of life scores were detected. CONCLUSIONS: In TEP hernia surgery, there was no benefit of lightweight over heavyweight meshes observed 2 years postoperatively.IMPORTANCE: Answering pages from nurses about patients in need of immediate attention is one of the most difficult challenges a resident faces during their first days as a physician. A Mock Page program has been developed and adopted into a national surgical resident preparatory curriculum to prepare senior medical students for this important skill. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess standardized mock page cases as a valid construct to assess clinical decision making and interprofessional communication skills. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Mock page cases (n = 16) were administered to 213 senior medical students from 12 medical schools participating in a national surgical resident preparatory curriculum in 2013 and 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical decision making and interprofessional communication were measured by case-specific assessments evaluating these skills which have undergone rigorous standard-setting to determine pass/fail cut points. RESULTS: Students' performance improved in general for both communication and clinical decision making over the 4-week course. Cases have been identified that seem to be best suited for differentiating high- from low-performing students. Chest pain, pulmonary embolus, and mental status change cases posed the greatest difficulty for student learners. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Simulated mock pages demonstrate an innovative technique for training students in both effective interprofessional communication and management of common postoperative conditions they will encounter as new surgical interns.PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between tooth loss and signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a representative sample of the general US population. METHODS: Data were from 7305 men and women aged â¥25Â years participating in the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Tooth loss, occlusal contacts, and denture use were determined by dental examination. Four cardinal OSA signs and symptoms were evaluated by questions based on American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria. Adults with â¥2 signs/symptoms of OSA were classified at high-risk of OSA. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95Â % confidence limits (CL) from log binomial regression models estimated the strength of association between tooth loss and high-risk for OSA, adjusting for demographic characteristics, body mass index, dentures, and sleep duration. RESULTS: Prevalence of high-risk for OSA increased 2Â % for each additional lost tooth (PRâ=â1.02, 95Â % CL, 1.01, 1.03) among adults aged 25 to 65Â years. When tooth loss was modeled as an ordinal variable with 0-4 lost teeth as the referent category, adjusted prevalence of high-risk for OSA was as follows: 25Â % greater in those missing 5-8 teeth (PRâ=â1.25, 95Â % CL, 1.07, 1.46); 36Â % greater in those missing 9-31 teeth (PRâ=â1.36, 95Â % CL, 1.06, 1.73); and 61Â % greater in the edentulous (PRâ=â1.61, 95Â % CL, 1.11, 2.33). CONCLUSION: Tooth loss may be an independent risk factor for OSA.Nitroglycerin (glycerol trinitrate, GTN) induces headache in migraineurs, an effect that has been used both diagnostically and in the study of the pathophysiology of this neurovascular pain syndrome. An important feature of this headache is a delay from the administration of GTN to headache onset that, because of GTN's very rapid metabolism, cannot be due to its pharmacokinetic profile. It has recently been suggested that activation of perivascular mast cells, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine, may contribute to this delay. We reported that hyperalgesia induced by intradermal GTN has a delay to onset of â¼30 min in male and â¼45 min in female rats. This hyperalgesia was greater in females, was prevented by pretreatment with the anti-migraine drug, sumatriptan, as well as by chronic pretreatment with the mast cell degranulator, compound 48/80. The acute administration of GTN and compound 48/80 both induced hyperalgesia that was prevented by pretreatment with octoxynol-9, which attenuates endothelial function, suggesting that GTN and mast cell-mediated hyperalgesia are endothelial cell-dependent. Furthermore, A-317491, a P2X3 antagonist, which inhibits endothelial cell-dependent hyperalgesia, also prevents GTN and mast cell-mediated hyperalgesia. We conclude that delayed onset mechanical hyperalgesia induced by GTN is mediated by activation of mast cells, which in turn release mediators that stimulate endothelial cells to release ATP, to act on P2X3, a ligand-gated ion channel, in perivascular nociceptors. A role of the mast and endothelial cell in GTN-induced hyperalgesia suggest potential novel risk factors and targets for the treatment of migraine.PMID: 26779798  [PubMed - in process]BACKGROUND: Fish bone migration from the gastrointestinal tract into the liver is an unusual cause of liver abscess. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe successful laparoscopic removal of intrahepatic fish bones in 2 patients who presented with liver abscesses. Both patients were admitted to our institution with a 2-week history of right upper quadrant pain, fever, chills, and rigors. Radiological imaging revealed the presence of a linear calcified foreign body within a hepatic abscess in the left lateral section of the liver. These findings were suggestive of infection secondary to migration of fish bone from the stomach to the liver. RESULTS: Both patients underwent percutaneous drainage of liver abscesses with control of sepsis, followed by laparoscopic removal of intrahepatic fish bones. Localization of the fish bones was facilitated by intraoperative ultrasonographic examination of the liver. Postoperative recovery was fast and uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of two consecutive cases of liver abscess caused by fish bone migration where our patients were successfully treated by percutaneous drainage of the abscess followed by laparoscopic removal of intrahepatic fish bone.AIMS: This study evaluated the safety, feasibility, and short-term outcomes of laparoscopic extralevator abdominoperineal excision (laparoscopic-ELAPE) with primary suturing for low rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic-ELAPE with primary suturing for low rectal cancer at our institution between September 2013 and January 2015 were retrospectively identified from a prospectively maintained database. Short-term outcomes, including intraoperative complications, postoperative morbidity, and oncologic adequacy of surgical specimens, were evaluated. RESULTS: Laparoscopic-ELAPE was successful in all 33 included patients, with no patient requiring conversion to an open approach. Mean operation time was 200 minutes, and mean intraoperative blood loss was 90âmL. Except for bowel perforation in 2 patients (6.1%), there were no intraoperative complications. Two patients (6.1%) had positive circumferential resection margins. Median length of hospital stay was 7 days. The 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 15.2% and 0%, respectively. Postoperative complications within 30 postoperative days included perineal wound infection (2 patients, 6.1%), respiratory infection (2 patients, 6.1%), and chylous fistula (1 patient, 3.0%). Complications at a median follow-up time of 12 months (range, 3-19 months) included local tumor recurrence (1 patient, 3.0%), perineal dehiscence (2 patients, 6.1%), perineal seroma (1 patient, 3.0%), bowel obstruction (1 patient, 3.0%), urinary retention (2 patients, 6.1%), and chronic perineal pain (2 patients, 6.1%). There were no instances of perineal hernia, persistent sinus, or peristomal hernia. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-ELAPE with primary suturing appears to be a feasible and safe treatment approach for low rectal cancer, with acceptable short-term outcomes.BACKGROUND: Radial artery puncture is a common procedure and yet the role of local anesthesia for reducing the pain of this procedure continues to be debated. Clinical practice is variable and there is potential for substantial financial savings. This is the first randomized trial to investigate the effectiveness of subcutaneously injected lidocaine anesthesia on the perceived pain of radial artery puncture and the financial impact. METHODS: Between December 2012 and April 2013, 43 patients in the Emergency Department were randomized into the intervention group to receive lidocaine 1% 1 mL subcutaneously or the control group (to receive no local anesthesia) prior to radial artery puncture for blood gas sampling. Pain was rated on a 10 cm visual analogue scale and procedural variables collected for between group analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 41 participants were included. Subcutaneously injected lidocaine anesthesia did not reduce the median pain of radial artery puncture (control 1.8 vs. intervention 1.6 cm, P = 0.938). Those patients who had other systemically acting analgesia appeared to report reduced pain for radial artery puncture (0.60 vs. 2.30 cm, P = 0.105) as did those where a smaller 25-gauge needle was used compared to the standard 22-gauge (1.40 vs. 4.35 cm, P = 0.150), although these were not statistically significant. Anxious patients and those requesting local anesthesia experienced relatively higher levels of pain. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia did not reduce the perceived pain of radial artery puncture.The open access model, where researchers can publish their work and make it freely available to the whole medical community, is gaining ground over the traditional type of publication. However, fees are to be paid by either the authors or their institutions. The purpose of this paper is to assess the proportion and type of open access evidence-based articles in the form of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the field of musculoskeletal disorders and orthopedic surgery. PubMed database was searched and the results showed a maximal number of hits for low back pain and total hip arthroplasty. We demonstrated that despite a 10-fold increase in the number of evidence-based publications in the past 10 years, the rate of free systematic reviews in the general biomedical literature did not change for the last two decades. In addition, the average percentage of free open access systematic reviews and meta-analyses for the commonest painful musculoskeletal conditions and orthopedic procedures was 20% and 18%, respectively. Those results were significantly lower than those of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the remaining biomedical research. Such findings could indicate a divergence between the efforts engaged at promoting evidence-based principles and those at disseminating evidence-based findings in the field of musculoskeletal disease and trauma. The high processing fee is thought to be a major limitation when considering open access model for publication.Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to perceive, manage, and reason about emotions and to use this information to guide thinking and behavior adaptively. Youth with callous-unemotional (CU) traits demonstrate a variety of affective deficits, including impairment in recognition of emotion and reduced emotional responsiveness to distress or pain in others. We examined the association between ability EI and CU traits in a sample of incarcerated adolescents (nÂ =Â 141) using an expert-rater device (Psychopathy Checklist Youth Version (PCL-YV; Manual for the Hare psychopathy checklist: Youth version. Multi-Health Systems, Toronto, 2003) and self-report assessments of CU traits. EI was assessed using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test-Youth Version, Research Version (MSCEIT-YV-R; MSCEIT YV: Mayer-Salovey-Caruso emotional intelligence test: Youth version, research version 1.0. Multi-Health Systems, Toronto, Ontario, 2005). Similar to findings in adult forensic populations, high levels of CU traits in incarcerated adolescents were associated with lower EI, particularly higher order EI skills. Identifying impairment on EI abilities may have important implications for emerging treatment and intervention developments for youth with high levels of CU traits.Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) frequently metastasizes to the bone, often resulting in painful skeletal events, reduced quality of life, and reduced survival. The beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals strontium-89 and samarium-153 alleviated pain in mCRPC patients with widespread skeletal metastases and have been associated with myelotoxicity. Radium-223, a first-in-class alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical, prolonged overall survival, delayed symptomatic skeletal events, and improved quality of life, versus placebo, in patients with CRPC and symptomatic bone metastases and no visceral metastases. Radium-223 provided survival benefit to patients with CRPC and symptomatic bone metastases, regardless of prior docetaxel use. Importantly, prostate-specific antigen level and pain palliation were not a measure of radium-223 treatment response and should not alter the decision to administer all six radium-223 injections, the recommended regimen for survival benefit. Radium-223 was generally well tolerated, leading to ongoing clinical trials in combination with other therapeutics. Thus, radium-223 is a valuable addition to the mCRPC treatment armamentarium.PMCID: PMC4588370 PMID: 26779563  [PubMed - in process]BACKGROUND: Females experience greater overall rates of athletic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury than males. The specific mechanisms of the predisposition remain unclear. HYPOTHESIS: Modeling of knee kinematics has shown that the more extended the knee joint, the greater the strain on the ACL. The authors hypothesized that female athletes would have a lesser degree of knee flexion than male athletes at initial ground contact while performing change-of-direction cutting maneuvers. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Twenty female and 20 male high school soccer athletes with at least 1 year of experience were recruited for the study. Athletes were excluded if they had a history of any major lower limb injury or current knee pain causing a reduction in training and/or competition. Reflective markers were attached at the greater trochanter of the femur, the lateral epicondyle of the knee, and the lateral malleolus of the ankle to enable motion capture. Each athlete performed 6 change-of-direction maneuvers in random order in front of 2 cameras. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine differences between the sexes from the motion data captured; P < .05 defined significance. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences existed in knee flexion angles between male and female participants at the 90Â° and 135Â° cutting angles. At 90Â°, males and females showed initial contact knee flexion angles (mean Â± SD) of 39.0Â° Â± 6.8Â° and 29.3Â° Â± 6.2Â°, respectively (P < .0001), and mean maximum flexion angles of 56.4Â° Â± 6.9Â° and 49.7Â° Â± 7.0Â°, respectively (P = .0036). At 135Â°, males and females showed mean initial contact knee flexion angles of 36.8Â° Â± 7.9Â° and 29.7Â° Â± 7.8Â°, respectively (P = .0053), and mean maximum flexion angles of 60.7Â° Â± 8.1Â° and 51.6Â° Â± 9.4Â°, respectively (P = .0017). CONCLUSION: The research conducted is intended to foster an awareness of injury disposition in female athletes and guide future endeavors to develop, test, and implement a proactive approach in lowering female noncontact athletic ACL injury rates. This project adds to the literature as wider side-cut maneuvers (â¥90Â°) were studied, as compared with previous studies using small side-cut angles (<90Â°), offering a model for alternative sports actions.Meniscal tears are the most common knee injury, and partial meniscectomies are the most common orthopaedic surgical procedure. The injured meniscus has an impaired ability to distribute load and resist tibial translation. Partial or complete loss of the meniscus promotes early development of chondromalacia and osteoarthritis. The primary goal of treatment for meniscus-deficient knees is to provide symptomatic relief, ideally to delay advanced joint space narrowing, and ultimately, joint replacement. Surgical treatments, including meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT), high tibial osteotomy (HTO), and distal femoral osteotomy (DFO), are options that attempt to decrease the loads on the articular cartilage of the meniscus-deficient compartment by replacing meniscal tissue or altering joint alignment. Clinical and biomechanical studies have reported promising outcomes for MAT, HTO, and DFO in the postmeniscectomized knee. These procedures can be performed alone or in conjunction with ligament reconstruction or chondral procedures (reparative, restorative, or reconstructive) to optimize stability and longevity of the knee. Complications can include fracture, nonunion, patella baja, compartment syndrome, infection, and deep venous thrombosis. MAT, HTO, and DFO are effective options for young patients suffering from pain and functional limitations secondary to meniscal deficiency.Introduction. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Dynesys dynamic stabilization (DDS) on clinical and radiographic outcomes, including spinal pelvic alignment. Method. Consecutive patients who underwent 1- or 2-level DDS for lumbar spondylosis, mild degenerative spondylolisthesis, or degenerative disc disease were included. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Visual Analogue Scale for back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index, and the Japanese Orthopedic Association scores. Radiographic outcomes were assessed by radiographs and computed tomography. Pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis (LL) were also compared. Results. In 206 patients with an average follow-up of 51.1 Â± 20.8 months, there were 87 screws (8.2%) in 42 patients (20.4%) that were loose. All clinical outcomes improved at each time point after operation. Patients with loosened screws were 45 years older. Furthermore, there was a higher risk of screw loosening in DDS involving S1, and these patients were more likely to have loosened screws if the LL failed to increase after the operation. Conclusions. The DDS screw loosening rate was overall 8.2% per screw and 20.4% per patient at more than 4 years of follow-up. Older patients, S1 involvement, and those patients who failed to gain LL postoperatively were at higher risk of screw loosening.Ewing sarcoma is the second most common pediatric bone tumor, with three cases per million worldwide. In clinical terms, Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive, rapidly fatal malignancy that mainly develops not only in osseous sites (85%) but also in extra-skeletal soft tissue. It spreads naturally to the lungs, bones, and bone marrow with poor prognosis in the two latter cases. Bone lesions from primary or secondary (metastases) tumors are characterized by extensive bone remodeling, more often due to osteolysis. Osteoclast activation and subsequent bone resorption are responsible for the clinical features of bone tumors, including pain, vertebral collapse, and spinal cord compression. Based on the "vicious cycle" concept of tumor cells and bone resorbing cells, drugs, which target osteoclasts, may be promising agents as adjuvant setting for treating bone tumors, including Ewing sarcoma. There is also increasing evidence that cellular and molecular protagonists present in the bone microenvironment play a part in establishing a favorable "niche" for tumor initiation and progression. The purpose of this review is to discuss the potential therapeutic value of drugs targeting the bone tumor microenvironment in Ewing sarcoma. The first part of the review will focus on targeting the bone resorbing function of osteoclasts by means of bisphosphonates or drugs blocking the pro-resorbing cytokine receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand. Second, the role of this peculiar hypoxic microenvironment will be discussed in the context of resistance to chemotherapy, escape from the immune system, or neo-angiogenesis. Therapeutic interventions based on these specificities could be then proposed in the context of Ewing sarcoma.Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 3% of all cancer cases. RCCs usually metastasize to the lungs, bones, liver, or brain. Only <1% of patients with bone metastases manifested clavicular RCC metastases. Thus, clavicular metastasis as the initial presentation of RCC is extremely rare. We report a patient with RCC metastasis to the left clavicle, which was first presented with pain caused by a pathological fracture. Magnetic resonance image revealed a renal tumor, and technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy showed multiple osseous metastases. The patient eventually underwent surgery to remove the lateral end of the left clavicle and right kidney. Histopathology revealed renal tumor and clear cell carcinoma in the clavicle. Finally, we review 17 cases of clavicular metastases originating from different malignancies.Infectious abdominal aortic aneurysms often present with abdominal and lower back pain, but prolonged fever may be the only symptom. Infectious abdominal aortic aneurysms initially presenting with meningitis are extremely rare; there are no reports of their successful treatment. Cases with Streptococcus pneumoniae as the causative bacteria are even rarer with a higher mortality rate than those caused by other bacteria. We present the case of a 65-year-old man with lower limb weakness and back pain. Examination revealed fever and neck stiffness. Cerebrospinal fluid showed leukocytosis and low glucose levels. The patient was diagnosed with meningitis and bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and treated with antibiotics. Fever, inflammatory response, and neurologic findings showed improvement. However, abdominal computed tomography revealed an aneurysm not present on admission. Antibiotics were continued, and a rifampicin soaked artificial vascular graft was implanted. Tissue cultures showed no bacteria, and histological findings indicated inflammation with high leukocyte levels. There were no postoperative complications or neurologic abnormalities. Physical examination, blood tests, and computed tomography confirmed there was no relapse over the following 13 months. This is the first reported case of survival of a patient with an infectious abdominal aortic aneurysm initially presenting with meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.Ketamine is reported to be an effective adjuvant to opioids in the treatment of refractory cancer pain; however, the use of high doses of ketamine for extended periods in pediatric patients has not been described. We present a five-year-old male with grade IV intestinal GVHD whose abdominal pain required both hydromorphone and ketamine for a period of over four months. There was no evidence of hepatotoxicity, hemorrhagic cystitis, or other adverse effects. Possible withdrawal symptoms were mild and were readily mitigated by gradually weaning ketamine.Objectives. To determine the barriers that hinder early seeking of medical care among Minia's myocardial infarction patients. Methods. The study was based on individual interviews with 207 men and women with a first confirmed myocardial infarction (MI), admitted to the coronary care units of hospitals in Minia city in the period from April 1 to August 30, 2014. Data was collected via structured questionnaire and patient medical charts. The delay was evaluated by assisting patients to triangulate time of symptom onset and time of professional health care by placing both times in context of daily activities that participants could easily remember. Results. The median (25th, 75th percentiles) delay time was 4 (2, 10)âh. Only 32.8% of patients arrived within 2 hours of symptoms onset. Variables that significantly predicted prehospital delay time were patient's misinterpretation of nature of pain with OR 8.98 (95% CI) (3.97-20.32), illiteracy 7.98 (2.77-22.95), age (>65) 5.07 (1.57-16.29), and pain resistance behavior 4.61 (2.04-10.41). Conclusions. Interventions to decrease prehospital delay must focus on improving public awareness of acute myocardial infarction symptoms and increasing their knowledge on early treatment benefits.INTRODUCTION: Knee arthroplasty is a frequently used surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of cold therapy after knee arthroplasty. METHODS: 60 patients who were operated in our clinic between the years 2013 and 2014 were evaluated prospectively, and the patients were randomized into two groups. The cold therapy by Cryo/Cuff application was started 2Â h before the surgery in Group-2 patients; it was repeated in a postoperative 6th hour and continued for postoperative four days. We analyzed the visual analog scales (VAS) for pain, Knee Society Scores (KSS), hemoglobin, and bleeding parameters. RESULTS: The data of the group that did not receive the Cryo/Cuff application (Group-1) are as follows; the number of the patients was 33; the mean age value was 68,4 (53-78). Group-2 data was as follows; the number of the patients was 27; the mean age value was 67.2 years (range 57-78). The mean KSS scores of the patients increased from 79.6 (75-83) and to 90.5 (88-92) postoperatively (pÂ <Â 0.05). DISCUSSION: In our study, the pain and functional knee scores of the patients who received Cryo/Cuff application were significantly different and as expected, the use of analgesics was much lower. Cryotherapy did not affect the amount of bleeding during the surgery (pÂ >Â 0.05), which was not reported previously in the literature. CONCLUSION: After knee arthroplasty, the preoperative and postoperative use of cryotherapy is effective in terms of the pain control and functional knee scores without a significant change in surgical blood loss.We aimed to evaluate the impact in sleep quality and musculoskeletal pain of a Medium-Firm Mattress (MFM), and their relationship with objective sleep parameters in a group of institutionalized elders. The sample size included forty older adults with musculoskeletal pain. We did a clinical assessment at baseline and weekly trough the study period of four weeks. We employed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Pain Visual Analog Scale (P-VAS). Additionally a sub-group of good sleepers, selected from PSQI baseline evaluation, were studied with actigraphy and randomized to MFM or High Firm Mattress (HFM), in two consecutive nights. We found a significant reduction of cervical, dorsal and lumbar pain. PSQI results did not change. The actigraphy evaluation found a significant shorter sleep onset latency with MFM, and a slightly better, but not statistically significant, sleep efficiency. The medium firmness mattress improved musculoskeletal pain and modified the sleep latency.Radiotherapy (RT), an integral part of the oncologic treatment for patients with head and neck cancer, can cause adverse side effects such as oral mucositis (OM). Pain from OM can impact a patient's quality of life and interrupt RT treatment schedules, which decreases the probability for achieving cancer cure. Conventionally, RT-induced OM pain is treated with analgesics and/or mouthwash rinses. Doxepin, a traditional tricyclic antidepressant with analgesic and anesthetic properties when applied topically to the mucosa, has been shown to lower OM pain in multiple single-arm trials (Epstein et al.) and more recently, in a placebo-controlled crossover study (Leenstra and Miller et al.). Currently, a placebo-controlled study (Sio and Miller et al.) using doxepin for esophagitis pain caused by RT to the thorax is underway. Doxepin will also be further compared with magic mouthwash and a placebo solution in a three-arm trial (Miller and Sio et al.) with head and neck cancer patients with OM pain caused by RT. Doxepin may represent a new standard for treating RT-induced OM pain in the future.The objective was to study the effect of whole-body vibration (WBV) on strength, balance and pain in patients with peripheral neuropathies and to consider its significance for the rehabilitation of patients suffering from chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Using a broad search strategy, PubMed was searched for clinical trials on WBV interventions aimed at improving strength, balance or pain in patients with peripheral neuropathies, which were published in English until 5(th) June 2014. The search was performed by the first author and generated a total of 505 results, which yielded 5 articles that met the inclusion criteria, being studies: i) published in English; ii) involving adult human subjects' peripheral neuropathies; iii) evaluating the effect of WBV as a therapeutic intervention; and iv) reporting findings for at least one of the following outcomes: strength, balance or pain. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed independently by first and second author, using the physiotherapy evidence database scale. The overall methodological quality of included studies was low. Two studies found a beneficial effect of WBV on neuropathic pain, but another study failed to find the same effect. One study found significant improvements in both muscle strength and balance, while another study found improvements only in some, but not all, of the applied tests to measure muscle strength and balance. The results of this literature search suggest insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness for the effects of WBV on neuropathic pain, muscle strength and balance in patients with peripheral neuropathies. More high-quality trials are needed to guide the optimization of rehabilitation programs for cancer survivors with CIPN in particular.Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. This chronic, gynecological inflammatory disease results in a decreased quality of life for patients, with the main symptoms including chronic pelvic pain and infertility. The steroid hormone 17-Î² Estradiol (E2) plays a key role in the pathology. Our previous studies showed that the anti-inflammatory lipid Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) acts as an estrogen receptor-alpha agonist in endometrial epithelial cells, inhibiting certain E2-mediated effects. LXA4 also prevents the progression of endometriosis in a mouse model via anti-proliferative mechanisms and by impacting mediators downstream of ER signaling. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine global proteomic changes evoked by E2 and LXA4 in endometriotic epithelial cells. E2 impacted a greater number of proteins in endometriotic epithelial cells than LXA4. Interestingly, the combination of E2 and LXA4 resulted in a reduced number of regulated proteins, with LXA4 mediating a suppressive effect on E2-mediated signaling. These proteins are involved in diverse pathways of relevance to endometriosis pathology and metabolism, including mRNA translation, growth, proliferation, proteolysis, and immune responses. In summary, this study sheds light on novel pathways involved in endometriosis pathology and further understanding of signaling pathways activated by estrogenic molecules in endometriotic epithelial cells.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe chiropractic and acupuncture care of a patient with acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) symptoms. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 31-year-old woman had acute neck pain, headache, dizziness, nausea, tinnitus, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue following a fall. She was diagnosed at an urgent care facility with mTBI immediately following the fall. Pharmaceutical intervention had been ineffective for her symptoms. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was treated with chiropractic adjustments characterized as high velocity, low amplitude thrusts directed to the cervical spine and local acupuncture points in the cervical and cranial regions. The patient received care for a total of 8 visits over 2.5 weeks with resolution of concussive symptoms. CONCLUSION: This patient with mTBI responded favorably to a conservative treatment protocol with the combination of chiropractic and acupuncture care.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case study is to describe the evaluation and management of patellar dislocations and the different approaches used from providers in different countries. CLINICAL FEATURES: An individual dislocated her left patella while traveling abroad and received subsequent care in Thailand, China, and the United States. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Nonoperative treatment protocols including manual closed reduction of the patella, casting of the leg, and rehabilitation exercises were employed. CONCLUSION: Receipt of care when abroad can be challenging. The patient's knee range of motion and pain continued to improve when she was diligent about performing the home exercise program. This case highlights the importance of a thorough examination, a proper regimen of care, and patient counseling to ensure a full recovery and minimize the chance of re-injury.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report is to describe a case in which early detection and proper follow-up of spontaneous vertebral artery dissection led to satisfactory outcomes. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 34-year old white woman reported to a chiropractic clinic with a constant burning pain at the right side of her neck and shoulder with a limited ability to turn her head from side to side, periods of blurred vision, and muffled hearing. Dizziness, visual and auditory disturbances, and balance difficulty abated within 1Â hour of onset and were not present at the time of evaluation. A pain drawing indicated burning pain in the suboccipital area, neck, and upper shoulder on the right and a pins and needles sensation on the dorsal surface of both forearms. Turning her head from side-to-side aggravated the pain, and the application of heat brought temporary relief. The Neck Disability Index score of 44 placed the patient's pain in the most severe category. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was not treated on the initial visit but was advised of the possibility of a vertebral artery or carotid artery dissection and was recommended to the emergency department for immediate evaluation. The patient declined but later was convinced by her chiropractor to present to the emergency department. A magnetic resonance angiogram of the neck and carotid arteries was performed showing that the left vertebral artery was hypoplastic and appeared to terminate at the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery. There was an abrupt moderately long segment of narrowing involving the right vertebral artery beginning near the junction of the V1 and V2 segments. The radiologist noted a concern regarding right vertebral artery dissection. Symptoms resolved and the patient was cleared of any medications but advised that if symptoms reoccurred she was to go for emergency care immediately. CONCLUSION: Recognition and rapid response by the chiropractic physician provided the optimum outcome for this particular patient.Shoulder pain complaints are common in our environment. The disorder can occur among the young active age group or in the older patients as a result of degenerative changes with its attendant limitations of the function of the affected upper limb, hindrance of the performance of activities of daily living, and reduced quality of life. The traditional oral analgesics, physiotherapy, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections are seldom ineffective at providing the desired pain relief and functional improvement at the shoulder joint. We investigated the role of fluoroscopic-guided supra-scapular nerve blocks (SSNBs) in patients with shoulder pain who failed to respond to the routine conservative management. With the patient lying prone and the C-arm fluoroscope placed in anterior-posterior position, the scapula notch was visualized and a 22G spinal needle was directed toward the nerve. The mixture of local anesthetic agent and steroid was injected as close to the nerve as possible after negative aspiration. Fluoroscopic-guided SSNB can produce substantial pain relief and improved range of movement in patients with painful shoulders. The procedure is safe, well tolerated, and can be done on a day-case basis.INTRODUCTION: In order to control serious pulpal pain following odontogenic infections in pregnant women, endodontic treatment may become necessary. The aim of this study was to assess the perception of dentists about rendering endodontic treatment to pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of resident doctors in the different dental specialties in Nigeria preparing for the various levels of the fellowship examinations of the West Africa College of Surgeons and the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria. Data were collected by the means of a 17-itemed questionnaire which sought information on respondents' demography, their considerations while rendering endodontic treatment to the pregnant patients and their perceptions of the safety of endodontic treatment in pregnancy. The data collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science version 21.0. RESULTS: With regards to the safety of endodontic treatment during pregnancy, 91.8% considered it safe, and this was not statistically significant in relation to the specialty or status of the respondent. Majority (77.0%) agreed they would undertake a root canal treatment on a pregnant patient with all respondents in restorative dentistry, prosthodontics, periodontics, and pedodontics in the affirmative while all in oral pathology would refuse to do such (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dental residents are aware of the safety of endodontic treatment in pregnant women. However, gaps exist in their knowledge, bringing to the fore, the need for inclusion of pregnancy-specific training in the dental postgraduate curriculum.The study aims were to compare maltreated and comparison adolescents' health problems and to identify how individual, family and home characteristics and maltreatment status affect adolescents' self-report of health status and health care use. The sample was 224 maltreated adolescents (mean age = 18.3 years) and 128 comparison adolescents (mean age = 18.15 years). Comparison adolescents reported more cold and pain symptoms during the previous 30 days but no differences in other physical health problems, self-assessment of their physical and mental health or health care use compared to maltreated adolescents. Girls were more likely to have had a dental checkup, to have seen a psychological counselor, and to self-identify their physical health as poor compared to boys. Older adolescents were less likely to have had a medical checkup or seen a psychological counselor than younger adolescents. A history of maltreatment was not related to health or health care disparities for adolescents growing up in the same low-income environment as adolescents without a maltreatment report. The environmental context and geographical location in which these adolescents grew up may be the primary driver in their health behaviors and health problems and not the experience of maltreatment.Controversy related to endoscopic or surgical management of pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis remains. Despite improvement in endoscopic treatments, surgery remains the best option for pain management in these patients.PMID: 26778826  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]PMID: 26778823  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]PMID: 26778822  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]PMID: 26778820  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]BACKGROUND: Epidural analgesia/anesthesia is used during surgery because it dramatically relieves pain and attenuates the stress response. Because limited data exist regarding the relative merits of hydromorphone (HM) and fentanyl (FENT), the objective was to determine which was more safe and effective. METHODS: Prospective case-matched, observational study evaluated elective surgery patients: 30Â HM and 60 FENT. Variables were measured perioperatively. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients, mean age was 52Â years; simplified acute physiology score was 26 Â± 10; and American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 2.4 HM vs 2.7 FENT, P = .03. HM patients were more apt to be excessively sedated (16% HM vs 1% FENT, P = .007) and have poor mental unresponsiveness (6% HM vs 0% FENT, P = .04). The incidence of hypotension was not different, 76% HM vs 80% FENT, not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In a closely case-matched population, FENT caused less excessive sedation and unresponsiveness. FENT patients had better intraoperative urine output and tended to have less repeated episodes of hypotension.BACKGROUND: States have attempted to reduce prescription opioid abuse through strengthening the regulation of pain management clinics; however, the effect of such measures remains unclear. We quantified the impact of Texas's September 2010 "pill mill" law on opioid prescribing and utilization. METHODS: We used the IMS Health LRx LifeLink database to examine anonymized, patient-level pharmacy claims for a closed cohort of individuals filling prescription opioids in Texas between September 2009 and August 2011. Our primary outcomes were derived at a monthly level and included: (1) average morphine equivalent dose (MED) per transaction; (2) aggregate opioid volume; (3) number of opioid prescriptions; and (4) quantity of opioid pills dispensed. We compared observed values with the counterfactual, which we estimated from pre-intervention levels and trends. RESULTS: Texas's pill mill law was associated with declines in average MED per transaction (-0.57mg/month, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.09, -0.057), monthly opioid volume (-9.99kg/month, CI -12.86, -7.11), monthly number of opioid prescriptions (-12,200 prescriptions/month, CI -15,300, -9,150) and monthly quantity of opioid pills dispensed (-714,000 pills/month, CI -877,000, -550,000). These reductions reflected decreases of 8.1-24.3% across the outcomes at one year compared with the counterfactual, and they were concentrated among prescribers and patients with the highest opioid prescribing and utilization at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Following the implementation of Texas's 2010 pill mill law, there were clinically significant reductions in opioid dose, volume, prescriptions and pills dispensed within the state, which were limited to individuals with higher levels of baseline opioid prescribing and utilization.OBJECTIVE: To assess the intra- and inter-session reliability of estimates of motor unit behavior and muscle fiber properties derived from high-density surface electromyography (HDEMG). METHODS: Ten healthy subjects performed submaximal isometric knee extensions during three recording sessions (separate days) at 10%, 30%, 50% and 70% of their maximum voluntary effort. The discharge timings of motor units of the vastus lateralis and medialis muscles were automatically identified from HDEMG by a decomposition algorithm. We characterized the number of detected motor units, their discharge rates, the coefficient of variation of their inter-spike intervals (CoVisi), the action potential conduction velocity and peak-to-peak amplitude. Reliability was assessed for each motor unit characteristics by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Additionally, a pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) was calculated, to verify the accuracy of the decomposition. RESULTS: Good to excellent reliability within and between sessions was found for all motor unit characteristics at all force levels (ICCs>0.8), with the exception of CoVisi that presented poor reliability (ICC<0.6). PNR was high and similar for both muscles with values ranging between 45.1 and 47.6dB (accuracy>95%). CONCLUSION: Motor unit features can be assessed non-invasively and reliably within and across sessions over a wide range of force levels. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that it is possible to characterize motor units in longitudinal intervention studies.Unilateral condylar overgrowth induces severe facial asymmetry. Therefore, treatment focuses on both elimination of the condyle lesion and correction of the facial asymmetry. The aim of this report is to present three patient cases, introducing a simpler surgical method, the indications for this surgical method, and a treatment planning flow that is consistently applicable regardless of the origin of the condylar lesion. Condylectomy was performed simultaneously with orthognathic surgery, with the vertical ramus osteotomy selected as the method of ramus surgery; ipsilateral ramus surgery was not performed on the condylectomy side. This method is applicable in cases in which facial asymmetry originates solely from unilateral condylar overgrowth, and the maxilla and mandible are presumed to have been in the normal class I anteroposterior position before the onset of condylar lesion growth. After surgery, temporomandibular joint pain and/or mouth limitations were resolved, the new condyle showed satisfactory bone remodelling, and favourable facial symmetry was attained. The postoperative results were maintained long-term and there was no recurrence on the condylectomy side. This simply modified surgical strategy for facial asymmetry due to unilateral condylar overgrowth may be used in selected patients, regardless of the origin of the condylar lesion.PMID: 26778672  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]Amylin (AMY) is a member of calcitonin family of peptides. In this study, the effects of intrathecal (i.t) injection of AMY on the inflammatory pain and on the cAMP accumulation in the rat spinal cells were investigated. By using AMY receptor antagonists, we also studied the pharmacology of AMY receptors in the spinal cells. Formalin model of inflammatory pain was induced by intraplantar injection of formalin. AMY (0.06250-2500pmol/rat) was administrated i.t 15min before the injection of formalin. Antagonists were injected i.t 10min before the injection of AMY and/or morphine. AMY reduced formalin-induced pain in a dose dependent mode. This effect was inhibited by the potent AMY antagonist, AC187 but not CGRP8-37. rAMY8-37, most commonly reported as a weak AMY antagonist, showed to be equally or more potent than AC187 in antagonizing the above effects. The opioid antagonist, naloxone, had no significant effects on AMY antinociceptive effects. Primary dissociated cell culture was used to investigate the effect of AMY on cAMP production and to characterize AMY receptors in the spinal cells. AMY moderately increases cAMP accumulation in the spinal cells with an EC50 value of 74.62nM. This effect was not affected by CGRP8-37 but was inhibited by AC187 and rAMY8-37 with pA2 values of 7.94 and 7.87 respectively. In conclusion, effects of AMY in reducing formalin induced pain and on the cAMP accumulation by spinal cells are mediated through undefined receptors.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Costus pulverulentus C. Presl (Costaceae), a species endemic to Mexico, is used for the empirical treatment of cancer, pain, and inflammation. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity, as well as the cytotoxic, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and sedative effects of an ethanol extract from Costus pulverulentus stem (CPE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical characterization of CPE was performed by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The toxicity of CPE was evaluated using the comet assay (10-1000Âµg/ml during 5hours) and the acute toxicity test (500-5000mg/kg p.o. and i.p. during 14 days). The cytotoxic effect of CPE (1-250Âµg/ml) on human cancer cells was evaluated using the MTT assay. The antinociceptive effects of CPE (50-200mg/kg p.o.) were evaluated using thermal-induced nociception tests (hot plate and tail flick) and the chemical-induced nociceptive tests (acetic acid and formalin). The sedative activity of CPE (50-200mg/kg p.o.) was evaluated using the ketamine-induced sleeping time test. RESULTS: CPE showed the presence of compounds such as campesterol, stigmasterol Î²-sitosterol, vanillic acid, among others. In the comet assay, CPE at 200Âµg/ml or higher concentrations induced DNA damage. In the acute toxicity test, the LD50 estimated for CPE was>5000mg/kg p.o. or i.p. CEP showed moderate cytotoxic effects on prostate carcinoma cells PC-3 cells (IC50= 179Â±23.2Âµg/ml). In the chemical-induced nociception models, CPE (100 and 200mg/kg p.o.) showed antinociceptive effects with similar activity to 100mg/kg naproxen. In the thermal-induced nociception tests, CPE tested at 200mg/kg showed moderate antinociceptive effects by 28% (hot plate test) and by 25% (tail flick test). In the ketamine-induced sleeping time test, CPE showed no sedative effects. CONCLUSIONS: C. pulverulents exerts moderate cytotoxic effects in human cancer cells, moderate anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects. C. pulverulentus induces antinociceptive effects without inducing sedation.We review the state of the art in imaging-guided percutaneous interventional procedures used to diagnose and/or treat the diverse causes of back pain. These procedures can be used for diagnosis, treatment, or both. They are focused on the vertebral bodies, the facet joints, the intervertebral discs, and the nerve structures.OBJECTIVE: Cam hip shape morphology is a recognised cause of femoroacetabular impingement and is associated with hip osteoarthritis. Our aim was to systematically review the available epidemiological evidence assessing the prevalence of cam hip shape morphology in the general population and any studied subgroups including subjects with and without hip pain. DESIGN: All studies that reported the prevalence of cam morphology, measured by alpha angles, in subjects aged 18 and over, irrespective of study population or presence of hip symptoms were considered for inclusion. We searched AMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL in October 2015. Two authors independently identified eligible studies and assessed risk of bias. We planned to pool data of studies considered clinically homogenous. RESULTS: Thirty studies met inclusion criteria. None of the included studies were truly population-based: three included non-representative subgroups of the general population, 19 included differing clinical populations, while 8 included professional athletes. All studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. Due to substantial clinical heterogeneity meta analysis was not possible. Across all studies, the prevalence estimates of cam morphology ranged from 5-75% of participants affected. We were unable to demonstrate a higher prevalence in selected subgroups such as athletes or those with hip pain. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient high quality data to determine the true prevalence of cam morphology in the general population or selected subgroups. Well-designed population-based epidemiological studies that use homogenous case definitions are required to determine the prevalence of cam morphology and its relationship to hip pain.PMID: 26778453  [PubMed - in process]Access to pain prevention and relief of distress and suffering is a core element of universal healthcare. Prevention of all forms of pain and distress including pain during vaccination is an ethical duty for health providers and health systems. Yet most persons in low and middle income countries have little or no access to pain prevention. Furthermore, immunization pain can lead to vaccine hesitancy, and WHO has recognized that vaccine hesitancy is associated with decreased vaccination rates. In acknowledgement of these challenges, WHO SAGE has now published new guidance on preventing pain during vaccination [1].OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of four horses with severe corneal edema caused by suspected endothelial disease treated with a superficial keratectomy and Gundersen inlay flap and to determine whether this procedure (i) reduces corneal edema, (ii) reduces ocular pain, (iii) eliminates recurrent corneal ulceration, and (iv) improves vision in these horses. ANIMALS STUDIED: Four horses met inclusion criterion of (i) diagnosis with endothelial disease by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist and (ii) surgical treatment with a superficial keratectomy and Gundersen inlay flap. PROCEDURE: Retrospective medical record review of included horses was used to determine breed, age and sex of included horses, as well as details of medical and surgical therapy, and visual outcome. RESULTS: Four horses were presented with a complaint of focal corneal edema that progressed to diffuse corneal edema. Epithelial bullae and ulceration were present in all cases. The disease process was unresponsive to standard medical treatment with a hyperosmotic agent and topical and systemic anti-inflammatories. However, treatment with a superficial keratectomy and Gundersen inlay flap performed under general anesthesia was associated with (i) a significant decrease in corneal edema, (ii) increased comfort, (iii) elimination of corneal ulceration, and (iv) retention of vision postoperatively with little to no need for medical therapy. Follow-up time was 15, 12, 6, and 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: The superficial keratectomy and Gundersen inlay flap may provide a surgical alternative to chronic medical treatment of severe corneal edema in horses.OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the outcomes and outcome measures reported in randomized controlled trials and their relationship with methodological quality, year of publication, commercial funding, and journal impact factor. DATA SOURCES: We searched [1] Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, [2] Embase, and [3] MEDLINE from inception to November 2014. STUDY ELIGIBILITY: We included all randomized controlled trials evaluating a surgical intervention with or without a medical adjuvant therapy for the treatment of endometriosis symptoms. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality (Jadad score; range one to five), outcome reporting quality (MOMENT criteria; range one to six), year of publication, impact factor in the year of publication, and commercial funding (yes or no). Univariate and bivariate analysis were performed using Spearman Rh and Mann-Whitney U tests. We used a multivariate linear regression model to assess relationship associations between outcome reporting quality and other variables. RESULTS: There were 54 randomized controlled trials (5427 participants) which reported 164 outcomes and 113 outcome measures. The three most commonly reported primary outcomes were dysmenorrhea (10 outcome measures; 23 trials), dyspareunia (11 outcome measures; 21 trials), and pregnancy (3 outcome measures; 26 trials). The mean quality of outcome reporting was 3.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65 - 4.65) and methodological quality 3.61 (95% CI 2.35 - 4.88). Multivariate linear regression demonstrated a relationship between outcome reporting quality with methodological quality (Î²=0.325; p=0.038) and year of publication (Î²=0.067; p=0.040). No relationship was demonstrated between outcome reporting quality with journal impact factor (Rho=0.190; p=0.212) or commercial funding (p=0.370) COMMENT: Variation in outcome reporting within published endometriosis trials prohibits comparison, combination, and synthesis of data. This limits the usefulness of research to inform clinical practice, enhance patient care, and improve patient outcomes. In the absence of a core outcome set for endometriosis we recommend the use of the three commonest pain (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain) and sub-fertility (pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth) outcomes. International consensus among stakeholders is needed to establish a core outcome set for endometriosis trials.STUDY OBJECTIVE: The 2010 provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended eligibility for health insurance for young adults aged 19 to 25 years. It is unclear, however, how expanded coverage changes health care behavior and promotes efficient use of emergency department (ED) services. Our objective was to use population-level emergency department data to characterize any changes in diagnoses seen in ED among young adults since the implementation of the ACA dependent coverage expansion. METHODS: We performed a difference-in-differences analysis of 2009 to 2011 ED visits from California, Florida, and New York, using all-capture administrative data to determine how the use of ED services changed for clinical categories after the ACA provision among young adults aged 19 to 25 years compared with slightly older adults unaffected by the provision, aged 26 to 31 years. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 10,158,254 ED visits made by 4,734,409 patients. After the implementation of the 2010 ACA provision, young adults had a relative decrease of 0.5% ED visits per 1,000 people compared with the older group. For the majority of diagnostic categories, young adults' rates and risk of visit did not change relative to that ofÂ slightly older adults after the implementation of the ACA. However, although young adults' ED visits significantly increased for mental illnesses (2.6%) and diseases of the circulatory system (eg, nonspecific chest pain) (4.8%), visits decreased for pregnancy-related diagnoses and diseases of the skin (eg, cellulitis, abscess) compared with that of theÂ older group (3.7% and 3.1%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that increased coverage has kept young adults out of the ED for specific conditions that can be cared for through access to other channels. As EDs face capacity challenges, these results are encouraging andÂ offer insight into what could be expected under further insurance expansions from health care reform.INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore patients' values when selecting treatment for a tooth with apical periodontitis (AP), namely retention via root canal treatment (RCT) and extraction without replacement or replacement with implant-supported crowns or fixed or removable partial prostheses. METHODS: Through 2 surveys of patients (800 university patients and 200 community patients, response rateÂ =Â 43%) and dentists (498 Ontario endodontists, periodontists, prosthodontists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, response rateÂ =Â 40% and 1983 Ontario general dentists, response rateÂ =Â 15%), the importance of values that might be considered important to patients when selecting treatment options for a tooth with AP were recorded. Chi-square and Kendall's tau tests were used to respectively compare the importance rating frequency by each surveyed group and its correlation to their demographic variables (PÂ â¤Â .05). RESULTS: Patients considered communication and trust (94%), tooth retention (90%), esthetic outcome (84% regardless of location), cost (83%), longevity (83%), and preoperative pain (81%) as the most important decision values. Dentists overrated the importance of patients' previous experience with the treatment options (94% vs 72%), dental insurance (90% vs 70%), and intraoperative pain (79% vs 60%) while underestimating the importance of maintenance cost (60% vs 79%). CONCLUSIONS: Dentists should respect patients' views about esthetic outcome, longevity, and cost associated with treatment options for a tooth with AP. In particular, this survey highlights the value of communication and trust between patient and dentist and preservation of the natural tooth through RCT over implant-supported crown replacement when planning treatment for a tooth with AP.AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: Aims of the review were to establish the prevalence of acute pain for adults in hospital, to identify the amount of severe or unacceptable pain reported and to examine the prevalence of acute pain within medical units. BACKGROUND: Acute Pain Services have been established in the United Kingdom (UK) to improve pain management within surgical settings. Acute pain is a common symptom across all hospital settings. However, medical settings have traditionally been considered low risk for acute pain and have therefore not always been included in the provision provided by APS. As a result 82% of APS surveyed in the UK felt that pain management was suboptimal on medical units. DESIGN AND METHOD: This review follows the process of a systematic review. RESULTS: Hospital-wide pain prevalence obtained ranged from 37Â·7-84%, severe pain prevalence ranged from 9-36%. The papers reviewed were of variable quality and heterogeneous resulting in the wide range of pain prevalence. Higher prevalence of pain was found for surgical patients compared to medical patients, although up to 55% of medical patients' reported pain. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to determine a definite prevalence of pain for adults in hospital due to the variability of the studies examined. However, pain does remain a significant symptom with up to 35% of patients reporting severe pain and approximately 50% of medical patient reported pain. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Awareness of the extent of pain as a problem for patients is the first step to improving practice. This review has demonstrated that there is a need for similar Acute Pain Teams and services for the staff and patients admitted to all areas of the hospital, including medical units to help clinicians assess and treat pain in all areas of a hospital setting.OBJECTIVE: Though the initial etiologies of arthritis are multifactorial, clinically, patients share the prime complaints of the disease, pain. Here the authors assessed the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of UP1304, a composite that contains a standardized blend of extracts from the rhizome of Curcuma longa and the root bark of Morus alba, on rats with carrageenan-induced paw edema. METHODS: A plant library was screened for bradykinin receptor antagonists. In vivo, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of the standardized composite, UP1304, were evaluated in rats with carrageenan-induced paw edema using oral dose ranges of 100-400 mg/kg. Ibuprofen, at a dose of 200 mg/kg, was used as a reference compound. In vitro, cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibition assays were performed to evaluate the degree of inflammation. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in pain resistance and paw edema suppression were observed in animals treated with UP1304, when compared to vehicle-treated rats. Results from the highest dose of UP1304 (400 mg/kg) were similar to those achieved by ibuprofen treatment at 200 mg/kg. In vitro, UP1304 showed dose-dependent inhibition of the enzymatic activities of COX and LOX. A half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 9.6 Î¼g/mL for bradykinin B1 inhibition was calculated for the organic extract of C. longa. Curcumin showed Ki values of 2.73 and 58 Î¼g/mL for bradykinin receptors B1 and B2, respectively. CONCLUSION: Data presented here suggest that UP1304, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent of botanical origin, acted as a bradykinin receptor B1 and B2 antagonist, and inhibited COX and LOX enzyme activities. This compound should be considered for the management of symptoms associated with arthritis.BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, whose etiology is not completely understood. Different therapeutic approaches have been used with inconsistent results. This observation does not invalidate the continued search for alternative treatments aimed at improving quality of life (QoL) in FMS. OBJECTIVE: This study compared three classical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies: acupuncture (AC), electroacupuncture (EAC) and moxibustion (MX) in the management of pain and promotion of QoL in FMS patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: A preliminary, group-assigned, comparative study enrolled 30 women, mean age (46.90Â±9.24) years (range 20-60 years), who met the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for FMS diagnosis and a pain-pressure threshold (PPT) < 4 kg/cm(2). The study was conducted in a teaching tertiary-care medical institution from May 2010 through April 2012. AC, EAC and MX were delivered for 30 min, once a week, for 8 weeks, bilaterally at Neiguan (PC6), Hegu (LI4), Yanglingquan (GB34), Sanyinjiao (SP6) and Taichong (LR3) acupoints. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each week, immediately before treatment and after treatment, subjects were tested for PPTs, Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale (WBFPS; for pain intensity) and Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36: for QoL). RESULTS: There was no significant improvement in pain or reduction of tender points in any of the groups studied, at the end of the 8th session. Significant improvement of QoL was perceived in vitality (after AC treatment) and in mental health (after EAC and MX treatments). CONCLUSION: TCM therapies (AC, EAC and MX) promoted an improvement in the QoL in two areas (vitality and mental health) in FMS women. Further large-scale clinical trials are required to confirm this effect.BACKGROUND: In children with a poorly functioning kidney due to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or ureteropelvic junction obstruction, management is by nephrectomy with total or proximal ureterectomy. The complete removal of all the ureter minimizes the risk of future morbidity associated with the distal ureteral stump (DUS), including febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs), lower quadrant pain and hematuria, the so-called ureteral stump syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcome of the DUS after nephroureterectomy, we analyzed our recent experience of nephrectomy performed via retroperitoneoscopy and via laparoscopy. METHODS: The records of 21 consecutive patients (median age 3.5 years, range 1-10 years) who underwent nephroureterectomy via laparoscopy or via retroperitoneoscopy were retrospectively reviewed for symptoms caused by DUS and their management. Nephrectomy was undertaken for a poorly functioning dysplastic (4), scarred from VUR (10) or hydronephrotic (7) kidney. In the laparoscopic group (11 pts), 6 cases required nephrectomy for reflux while 5 patients were operated for hydronephrotic or dysplastic non-functioning kidney. In the retroperitoneoscopic group (10 pts), nephrectomy was performed for reflux in 4 cases versus 6 patients affected by hydronephrotic or dysplastic non-functioning kidney. The patients were evaluated using ultrasound (US) to check DUS length and clinically to evaluate symptoms due to a symptomatic DUS. RESULTS: The average length of surgery was 50Â min for laparoscopy and 80Â min for retroperitoneoscopy. The average of follow-up was 5 years. The length of DUS after laparoscopic nephrectomy was shorter (range 3-7Â mm, statistically significant) than the DUS after retroperitoneoscopy (range 2-5Â cm) (pÂ <Â 0.001). Laparoscopic patients were all asymptomatic. Two patients, after retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy, presented with recurrent UTIs; a voiding cystography revealed a VUR on the residual DUS and a redo surgery was performed in both the patients to remove the DUS (Figure). DISCUSSION: Several authors have stated that, in case of subtotal ureterectomy, the incidence of symptomatic DUS after nephrectomy for high-grade vesicoureteric reflux is low. However, in our series, the incidence of symptomatic DUS after nephroureterectomy was not insignificant (2/21, 9.5%). Symptoms related to a refluxing DUS occurred only in patients undergoing retroperitoneoscopic nephroureterectomy, where the DUS was longer than the DUS detected in laparoscopic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that laparoscopy permits removal of all the ureter near the bladder dome, in children with non-functioning kidney due to VUR, it is advisable to always perform a laparoscopic rather than a retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy to prevent problems related to a symptomatic DUS.Purpose To examine subjective health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults with congenital unilateral upper limb deficiency (UULD) in Norway and to explore the associations between demographic and clinical factors and HRQoL. Method Cross-sectional study comparing HRQoL, measured by SF-36, among adults with UULD and an age- and gender-matched control group from the Norwegian general population (NGP). Results Seventy-seven respondents, median age 42 years (range: 20-82); 71% were women. Most had left-sided (61%), below elbow (53%), transverse (73%) deficiency. Compared to the NGP, the UULD group reported reduced HRQoL on all SF-36 subscales except for the role emotional (RE) scale (p=0.321), mental health (MH) (p=0.055) and mental component summary (MCS) (p=0.064). The greatest difference was on the bodily pain (BP) scale (point difference of 20.0). Multiple linear regression models showed significant association between several physical- and mental SF-36 subscales and occupational status, occurrence of comorbidity and chronic pain. Conclusions Persons with UULD reported reduced HRQoL on most SF-36 subscales, mostly in the physical health domain. Employment status, occurrence of comorbidity and chronic pain seem to have a negative impact on the HRQoL. Measures that can reduce pain and loss of function should be given particular attention in UULD rehabilitation. Implications for Rehabilitation Persons with congenital unilateral upper limb deficiency (UULD) who experience pain and discomfort should seek professional help for evaluating their everyday coping strategies. Professionals who meet persons with UULD should examine anomalies, comorbidity, pain and employment status before choosing advices and actions. Individually adapted grip-improving devices, environments, physical exercise and pain management programs should be implemented early to reduce pain, loss of function and decreased HRQoL. A multidisciplinary approach is often necessary when counseling persons with UULD.PURPOSE: Chest pain is a common emergency department (ED) presentation that is often unexplained. Recent evidence suggests that disease of the microvessels (arterioles) as opposed to the coronary artery (conduit artery) could explain one third of these cases, particularly in women. Brachial artery reactivity (BAR) is a validated surrogate measure of coronary artery vasomotion. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare brachial artery conduit vessel function (BAR) and microvascular function (postischemic peak reactive hyperemia [RH]) in subjects with and without chest pain and grouped according to sex. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted from January through March 2010. Cases were patients admitted to an ED chest pain center with low to moderate risk of acute coronary syndrome; they were eligible for study if their creatinine level was <2.0 mg/dL and systolic blood pressure was >100 mm Hg or <180 mm Hg. Asymptomatic healthy volunteers on no medications were recruited as control subjects. BAR as a change in brachial artery diameter in response to transient forearm ischemia (endothelium-dependent vasodilation) and RH as a change in flow velocities were measured with a high-resolution ultrasound. Telephone follow-up visits were made at 1 month for recurrence of chest pain and recidivism. FINDINGS: A total of 57 patients and 21 control subjects were enrolled; there was 100% follow-up at 1 month. Most patients (86%) had at least 1 cardiac risk factor. Neither BAR nor RH varied significantly between patients and control subjects (P > 0.05). Symptomatic men had lower mean BAR than women (2.67% vs 6.22%; P < 0.01), even when normalized for shear stress (P = 0.01). Conversely, women with chest pain had lower RH compared with men (2.85 vs 4.61; P = 0.01). The sex-specific differences adjusted for age and Framingham risk scores persisted for BAR (P = 0.003) and RH (P = 0.002). Of 57 patients, 53% had recurrent pain, and 4 returned to the hospital within 1 month. IMPLICATIONS: Differences in BAR and RH in patients ruled out for myocardial infarction suggest that the pathophysiology of acute chest pain might be sex-specific. Men with chest pain exhibited lower BAR, indicating peripheral conduit artery dysfunction. Conversely, women with chest pain exhibited lower postischemic peak hyperemia, indicative of peripheral microvascular dysfunction. Sex differences in pathophysiology of chest pain and vascular dysfunction could inform development of effective therapeutics for patients with recurrent or persistent chest pain in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.Metastases to the spine from non-hepatocellular carcinomas, such as cholangiocarcinoma and angiosarcoma, occur rarely. With improvements in oncologic care, the number of patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer is expected to increase. We performed a systematic review of the literature to assess the clinical presentation, treatment, outcome and survival of patients diagnosed with non-hepatocellular carcinoma spinal metastasis using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. We identified 19 cases of spinal metastases from non-hepatocellular carcinomas that fit our pre-specified criteria. The mean age at presentation was 62.3years and cholangiocarcinoma was the most common subtype. Patients frequently presented with pain, weakness or paraparesis and at the time of diagnosis, most of them had multi-level involvement of the spine. A majority of patients with spinal metastasis were treated either with radiation or chemotherapy or received no treatment. A minority of the reports included information on survival, which revealed a median survival of 1.5months following diagnosis of the spinal metastasis. Although there is a paucity of published literature on non-hepatocellular carcinoma spinal metastasis, this systematic review provides descriptive clinical characteristics of these patients.Aorto-left atrial fistula (AAF) is rarely encountered in clinical practice, and the early diagnosis can be very challenging. This report describes a unique case of AAF caused by a gunshot injury and the pivotal role of transesophageal echocardiography for diagnosis and assessment.Intracardiac bronchogenic cyst has a rare occurrence. A 41-year-old man was referred to our hospital with intermittent precordial pain. Echocardiography combined with magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left ventricular cyst. The cyst was resected using extracorporeal and cardioplegic arrest. The histopathologic study revealed that it was a bronchogenic cyst.BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effects of ozone therapy (OT) on the early healing period of de-epitheliazed gingival grafts(DGG) placed for non-root coverage gingival augmentation by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). METHODS: Thirty three patients were assigned to one of the study groups: test groups: DGG + OT; control group: DGG alone and 30 completed the study. Ozone was applied on DGGs placed in the recipient bed and donor site immediately after surgery, and at 1 and 3 days post-surgery. Blood perfusion in the recipient site was measured by LDF on the day of surgery and at 1,2,3,6,8,10 and 13 days following surgery. Quality of life by using OHIP-14 and pain at the donor/recipient sites by using Visual Analog Scale(VAS) were also investigated. RESULTS: The increase in blood perfusion units in the test group was significantly higher than that in the control group on 1, 2, 3, 6 and 8 days post-surgery(p<0.001). Significant differences occurred between the test and control groups in terms of the VAS values during the first week post-surgery both for donor and recipient sites(p<0.05). The ozone treated group showed significantly higher quality of life than the control group on post-operative day 6 (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Ozone therapy enhanced blood perfusion units in the first post-operative week. This outcome is also consistent with improvement in wound healing accompanied by an increase in quality of life and decrease in post-operative pain in the test group.OnabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNTA) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of urinary incontinence due to neurogenic detrusor overactivity and for the treatment of refractory overactive bladder. As a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, onaBoNTA showed no difference over placebo in recently published studies. In contrast, treating interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) with onaBoNTA has shown efficacy, and the current American Urological Association guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS lists onaBoNTA as fourth-line treatment. This comprehensive review will present all studied applications of onaBoNTA within the lower urinary tract.Simultaneous bilateral fractures of the femoral neck are rare injuries, which are reportedly induced by low-speed energy with predisposing factors including systemic diseases, medications and eclamptic seizures. Those caused by high energy are even rarer. High energy-induced bilateral fractures of the femoral neck conceive of high incidence of mortality and present great challenges in the early management. We report one case of a 52-year-old man with simultaneous bilateral fractures of the femoral neck which resulted from a motor pedestrian accident. One-stage closed reduction and internal fixation was done following the emergent resuscitation and neurosurgical management for concomitant brain injuries. The fractures united. There was no pain in the hips, and they had a normal range of motion. The treatment protocol, mechanism of the injury and possible postoperative complications were discussed to expand a comprehensive understanding about these infrequent types of fractures.Mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is a key enzyme in cellular energy metabolism and provides approximately 40% of the proton-motive force that is utilized during mitochondrial ATP production. The dysregulation of complex I function - either genetically, pharmacologically or metabolically induced - has severe pathophysiological consequences that often involve an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Slow transition of the active (A) enzyme to the deactive, dormant (D) form takes place during ischemia in metabolically active organs such as the heart and brain. The re activation of Complex I occurs upon reoxygenation of ischemic tissue, a process which is usually accompanied by an increase in cellular ROS-production. Complex I in the D-form serves as a protective mechanism preventing the oxidative burst upon reperfusion, Conversely, however, the D-form is more vulnerable to oxidative/nitrosative damage. Understanding the so-called active/deactive (A/D) transition may contribute to the development of new therapeutic interventions for conditions like stroke, cardiac infarction and other ischemia-associated pathologies. In this review we summarize current knowledge on the mechanism of A/D transition of mitochondrial complex I considering recently available structural data and site-specific labeling experiments. In addition, this review discusses in detail the impact of the A/D transition on ROS-production by complex I, and S-nitrosation of a critical cysteine residue of subunit ND3 as a strategy to prevent oxidative damage and tissue damage during ischemia-reperfusion injury.BACKGROUND: The early short-term outcomes and complications after revision of the recalled Rejuvenate modular neck hip arthroplasty have not been previously reported. This study's purpose is to describe the early outcomes and complications after revision of the Rejuvenate modular femoral neck. METHODS: A retrospective cohort included 92 patients with 92 Rejuvenate modular neck total hip arthroplasty (THA) who underwent revision surgery between July 2011 and April 2014. Preoperative, 1-year, and 2-year patient-reported outcome measures including Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Short Form 12 (SF-12) were described in 92 patients. RESULTS: Complications arose in (12 of 92) 13% of patients including 8 greater trochanteric fractures, 1 intraoperative periprosthetic acetabular fracture, 2 dislocations, 1 early aseptic loosening, and 1 infection requiring a 2-stage revision. Overall, 66% of patients with a complication required reoperation. Significant changes were noted between preoperative and 1- and 2-year outcomes with respect to WOMAC pain score (PÂ = .0031), WOMAC total score (PÂ = .021), SF-12 mental component score (P < .0001), and physical component score (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients can expect an improvement in pain (WOMAC pain) and function (total WOMAC, SF-12 Physical Health Composite Scale), but overall worsening in the SF-12 mental component scores. Patients' physical function improvements are offset by worsened mental function scores. Patients undergoing revision of Rejuvenate modular neck THA implants should be counseled on modest functional improvements and relative frequency of complications.BACKGROUND: Manual therapy enhances pain-free range of motion and reduces pain levels, but its effect on shoulder muscle activity is unclear. This study aimed to assess the effects of a sustained glenohumeral postero-lateral glide during elevation on shoulder muscle activity. METHODS: Thirty asymptomatic individuals participated in a repeated measures study of the electromyographic activity of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, posterior deltoid, and middle deltoid. Participants performed four sets of 10 repetitions of shoulder scaption and abduction with and without a glide of the glenohumeral joint. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to assess the effects of movement direction (scaption and abduction), and condition (with and without glide) (within-subject factors) on activity level of each muscle (dependent variables). Significant MANOVAs were followed-up with repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: During shoulder scaption with glide, the supraspinatus showed a reduction of 4.1% maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVIC) (95% CI 2.4, 5.8); and infraspinatus 1.3% MVIC (95% CI 0.5, 2.1). During shoulder abduction with a glide, supraspinatus presented a reduction of 2.5% MVIC (95% CI 1.1, 4.0), infraspinatus 2.1% MVIC (95% CI 1.0, 3.2), middle deltoid 2.2% MVIC (95% CIÂ =Â 0.4, 4.1), posterior deltoid 2.1% MVIC (95% CI 1.3, 2.8). CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic individuals, sustained glide reduced shoulder muscle activity compared to control conditions. This might be useful in enhancing shoulder movement in clinical populations. Reductions in muscle activity might result from altered joint mechanics, including simply helping to lift the arm, and/or through changing afferent sensory input about the shoulder.A variety of conservative treatments for burn scars are available, but there is no clear consensus on the evidence. The purpose of this study was to summarize the available literature on the effects of conservative treatments of burn scars in adults. RCTs and CCTs were sought in three databases, reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant reviews. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network scoring system was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. Information on the study characteristics, results and interventions was extracted. Twenty-two articles were included into the review and categorized in six topics: 5 on massage therapy, 4 on pressure therapy, 6 on silicone gel application, 3 on combined therapy of pressure and silicone, 3 on hydration and 1 on ultrasound. Pressure and silicone therapy are evidence-based conservative treatments of hypertrophic scar formation after a burn producing clinically relevant improvement of scar thickness, redness and pliability. Massage therapy could have a positive result on scar pliability, pain and pruritus, but with less supporting evidence. The use of moisturizers and lotions could have an effect on itching, but the findings are contradictory. Of all other non-invasive treatments such as splinting, casting, physical activity, exercise and mobilizations no RCTs or CCTs were found.This manuscript reviews the available literature on remifentanil patient-controlled intravenous analgesia in labor focusing on efficacy and safety. Remifentanil compares favorably to other potent systemic opioids but with fewer opioid-related neonatal effects. However, remifentanil provides modest and short-lasting labor analgesia that is consistently inferior when compared to neuraxial analgesia. The initial analgesic effect provided with remifentanil also diminishes as labor progresses. In several studies, remifentanil induced significant respiratory depressant effects in laboring women with episodes of desaturation, hypoventilation and even apnea. Given the safety concerns, we recommend that remifentanil patient-controlled intravenous analgesia should not be a routine analgesia technique during labor. In cases where neuraxial analgesia is refused or contraindicated and the use of remifentanil justified, continuous and careful monitoring is required to detect respiratory depression to provide safe care of both the pregnant woman and unborn child.Neutrophils are recruited from the blood to sites of sterile inflammation, where they are involved in wound healing but can also cause tissue damage. During sterile inflammation, necrotic cells release pro-inflammatory molecules including formylated peptides. However, the signaling pathway triggered by formylated peptides to integrin activation and leukocyte recruitment is unknown. By using spinning-disk confocal intravital microscopy, we examined the molecular mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment to sites of focal hepatic necrosis inÂ vivo. WeÂ demonstrated that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) was required for multiple Mac-1 activation events involved in neutrophil recruitment and functions during sterile inflammation triggered by fMLF. The Src family kinase Hck, Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein, and phospholipase CÎ³2 were also involved in this pathway required for fMLF-triggered Mac-1 activation and neutrophil recruitment. Thus, we have identified a neutrophil Btk signalosome that is involved in a signaling pathway triggered by formylated peptides leading to the selective activation of Mac-1 and neutrophil recruitment during sterile inflammation.BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) is an emerging target in treating inflammatory skin diseases. Crisaborole topical ointment, 2% is a novel, boron-based, topical PDE4 inhibitor under investigation for treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: Adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with treatable AD lesions involving â¥10% to â¤35% body surface area (BSA) were enrolled into a phase 2a, open-label study comprising pharmacokinetic (PK), safety, tolerability, and efficacy assessments. Crisaborole topical ointment, 2% was applied twice daily to affected areas for 28 days, with dosage based on baseline treatable BSA. PK blood samples were collected on days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters, and vital signs. Efficacy assessments included the Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) score and severity of AD signs and symptoms. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled; 22 completed the study (1 patient discontinued due to an AE [application site dermatitis]). PK analysis demonstrated limited exposure to crisaborole topical ointment, 2% after 8 days of dosing. Ten patients reported a total of 19 AEs, most commonly application site pain and nasopharyngitis (3 patients each). There were no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory or vital sign parameters. Efficacy was demonstrated by reductions in mean ISGA and AD sign and symptom severity scores. At day 29, eight patients (35%) had achieved an ISGA score â¤1 with â¥2-grade improvement. Mean treatable BSA declined from 17.6% to 8.2%. CONCLUSION: These results provide preliminary evidence for the limited systemic exposure, safety, and effectiveness of crisaborole topical ointment, 2% in adolescents with mild to moderate AD.Endometriosis, one of the most common benign gynecological diseases, affects millions of women of childbearing age. Endometriosis-associated pain is a major cause of disability and compromised quality of life in women. Neuropathic mechanisms are believed to play an important role. An imbalanced sympathetic and sensory innervation (reduced sympathetic innervation, with unchanged or increased sensory innervation in endometriotic lesions) has been demonstrated in endometriosis in recent studies. And it is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis-associated pain. It is primarily considered to be a natural adaptive program to endometriosis-associated inflammation. However, it is important to further clarify whether other potential modulating factors are involved in this dysregulation. It is generally accepted that endometriosis is an estrogen dependent disease. Higher estrogen biosynthesis and lower estrogen inactivation in endometriosis can lead to an excess of local estrogen in endometriotic lesions. In addition to its proliferative and anti-inflammatory actions, local estrogen in endometriosis also exerts potential neuromodulatory effects on the innervation in endometriosis. The aim of this review is to highlight the role of estrogen in mediating this imbalanced sympathetic and sensory innervation in endometriosis, through direct and indirect mechanisms on sympathetic and sensory nerves. Theoretical elaboration of the underlying mechanisms provides new insights in supporting the therapeutic role of estrogen in endometriosis-associated pain.The excitability of substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn determines the processing of nociceptive information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK) channels on neurons supply strong negative feedback control on neuronal excitability by affecting afterhyperpolarization (AHP). However, the role of SK channels in regulating tonic-firing SG neuron excitability remains elusive. In the present study, whole-cell recordings were conducted in SG neurons from acute spinal cord slices of adult rats. The SK channel opener 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (1-EBIO) attenuated spike discharges and increased AHP amplitudes; this effect was mimicked by a high Ca(2+) external solution. Systemic administration of 1-EBIO attenuated the thermal-induced nociception behavior. Conversely, the inhibition of SK channels with apamin, a specific SK channel inhibitor, increased neuronal excitability and decreased the AHP amplitudes; this effect was mimicked by a Ca(2+)-free external solution. Apamin increased excitatory synaptic transmission by increasing the amplitudes of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (eEPSPs). This facilitation depended on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, extracellular Mg(2+) and intracellular Ca(2+). Voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs) were also involved in the apamin-induced effects. Strikingly, 1-EBIO action on decreasing excitability persisted in the presence of apamin, indicating that 1-EBIO manipulates SK channels via a pathway rather than via apamin-sensitive SK channels. The data reveal a previously uncharacterized mechanism for manipulating SG neuronal excitability by Ca(2+) conductances via both apamin-sensitive and apamin-insensitive pathways. Because SG neurons in the dorsal horn are involved in regulating nociception, manipulating neuronal excitability via SK channels indicates a potential therapeutic target.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several studies reported that hypnosis can modulate pain perception and tolerance by affecting cortical and subcortical activity in brain regions involved in these processes. We conducted an Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on functional neuroimaging studies of pain perception under hypnosis to identify brain activation-deactivation patterns occurring during hypnotic suggestions aiming at pain reduction, including hypnotic analgesic, pleasant, or depersonalization suggestions (HASs). DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: We searched the PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo databases; we included papers published in peer-reviewed journals dealing with functional neuroimaging and hypnosis-modulated pain perception. The ALE meta-analysis encompassed data from 75 healthy volunteers reported in 8 functional neuroimaging studies. RESULTS: HASs during experimentally-induced pain compared to control conditions correlated with significant activations of the right anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann's Area [BA] 32), left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6), and right insula, and deactivation of right midline nuclei of the thalamus. CONCLUSIONS: HASs during experimental pain impact both cortical and subcortical brain activity. The anterior cingulate, left superior frontal, and right insular cortices activation increases could induce a thalamic deactivation (top-down inhibition), which may correlate with reductions in pain intensity.FibromyalgiaÂ management remains complicated and challenging. Health information technology is an evidence-based, nonpharmacological self and symptom management strategy, but few studies have evaluated its feasibility for managing fibromyalgia patients in clinical practice. FibroGuide is an example of an evidence-based, interactive, and computer-based program comprised of 10 educational modules on fibromyalgia. Study aims were to: (1) develop a process for implementing FibroGuide into the routine care of patients with fibromyalgia, (2) evaluate the overall impact on fibromyalgia before and after a 12-week implementation, and (3) assess patient perspectives on using FibroGuide health information technology to assist in self-management. In this pilot study, 35 participants with fibromyalgia were recruited from an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse's outpatient clinic. Using a descriptive design, quantitative data analysis was employed to address study aims. Based on data collection pre- and post-intervention using paired samples testing, a statistically significant change (pÂ =Â .017) was observed in overall fibromyalgia impact (improved symptom severity, activity, and function). Majority felt that FibroGuide was helpful as part of their routine care, and nearly half reported that it assisted in their self-management. Although 65% noted that technology was an effective and efficient way to receive education for fibromyalgia management, 57% preferred talking to healthcare providers. Larger longitudinal studies are needed on the use of health information technology in fibromyalgia, evaluating both statistical and clinical significance, while decreasing barriers to participant use for this promising adjunct to clinical management. Providers need to be well educated on supporting self-management strategies and health information technology.Spinal metastasis from colorectal cancer occurs rarely. However, with increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in the setting of improved therapies, physicians are more likely to encounter such patients. We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent spine surgery for metastatic colorectal cancer from 2005-2011. Preoperative, operative and postoperative factors; functional outcome as determined by Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) and modified Rankin scale (mRS); and survival were recorded. Univariate analysis was performed, with patients stratified into two groups based on the position of the primary cancer, either proximal (colon) or distal (rectum) to the rectosigmoid junction. Fourteen patients, with a median age of 52 (interquartile range [IQR] 48-66)years, underwent 21 spine surgeries for metastatic colorectal cancer. Pain was the common presenting symptom (n=11, 79%), followed by motor weakness (n=8, 57%). Twenty-seven postoperative complications occurred in 11 (52%) patients. Baseline KPS and mRS remained stable in four (29%), improved in two (14%), worsened in six (43%), and was unknown in two (14%) at last follow-up. Patients with spinal metastasis from a rectal primary (n=6) had a significantly longer survival compared to those with a colon primary (n=8), with a median survival of 84 (IQR 56-103) versus 26 (IQR 19-44)months after primary diagnosis (p=0.002), 19 (IQR 13-27) versus five (IQR 3-9)months after spine metastasis diagnosis (p=0.010), and six (IQR 4-14) versus three (IQR 2-4)months after surgery (p=0.030). Patients with spinal metastasis arising from rectal primary lesions display longer survival compared to colon lesions. Consideration of these factors is essential to appropriately assess surgical candidacy.Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in children and adolescents is a rare condition. PHPT is usually sporadic and caused by parathyroid adenoma. Patients may present with bone pain, proximal myopathy, bony deformities, fractures, renal calculi, mass on the neck, or acute pancreatitis. A sixteen-year-old boy presented to our outpatient clinic with difficulty in walking due to swelling of both ankles. Ultrasonography revealed intratendinous calcific nodules in both Achilles tendons. Serum biochemistry showed hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Serum parathormone level was high (512 pg/mL). Parathyroid scanning revealed a suspected parathyroid adenoma. The patient underwent parathyroidectomy and the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma was confirmed by histopathology. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone, phosphate, and calcium returned to normal, and the tenderness over the Achilles tendon and the flow pattern on Doppler examination disappeared as well. In conclusion, hyperparathyroidism should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of tendonopathies. Early diagnosis can be crucial for prevention of severe complications.PMID: 26776973  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to present a case of paraneoplastic systemic hypertension and fever in an undiagnosed primary ciliary body carcinoma arising in a painful blind eye. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old white man with a history of blindness since childhood was enucleated for neovascular glaucoma because of intractable pain in his right eye. A histopathological examination revealed a ciliary body carcinoma. One year later, an invasive recurrence of his orbit and ethmoid was detected and a debulking procedure was performed. He had untreatable fever and multidrug-resistant systemic hypertension for 3 months before the neoplasm diagnosis. He recovered from fever and systemic hypertension only after tumor excision and relapsed 1 year later when synchronous tumor dissemination was shown through a computed tomography scan. Tumor metastases, despite surgery and chemotherapy, caused his death. CONCLUSIONS: Paraneoplastic symptoms such as fever and hypertension may be due to unrecognized ocular malignancy. This case report intends to emphasize the importance of histopathological examination of an enucleated phthisical painful blind eye.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study examined the effects of imidazoline I2 receptor agonists on the development of tolerance and physical dependence to repeated morphine treatment in rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Two groups of rats (n=9/group) were trained to lever press for sucrose (10%) presentation under a fixed ratio 10 schedule and the rate-suppressing effects of the opioids morphine and naltrexone and the I2 receptor agonist 2-BFI were examined weekly in rats treated with either daily morphine (20 mg/kg, s.c.) alone or in combination with 2-BFI (10 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. Changes in body weight were measured following naltrexone tests in both groups of rats. In separate experiments, the antinociceptive effects of morphine were assessed using a warm water tail withdrawal procedure in rats before and after daily treatments (7 days) with morphine (32 mg/kg, i.p.) alone or in combination with various doses of the I2 receptor agonists 2-BFI, BU224 and CR4056. KEY RESULTS: Repeated treatment (daily for 3 weeks) of morphine in combination with 2-BFI produced significantly less tolerance to the rate-suppressing effects of morphine, produced a decreased sensitivity to the rate-suppressing effects of naltrexone as well as decreased naltrexone-precipitated body weight loss as compared to morphine alone group. Repeated treatment (7 days) with morphine produced antinociceptive tolerance which was attenuated by co-administration with 2-BFI, BU224 or CR4056. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Imidazoline I2 receptor agonists attenuate the development of tolerance and physical dependence to morphine, which further supports the therapeutic potential of combining I2 receptor agonists and opioids for pain treatment.

Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) with cross-linking and stabilization of collagen has been hypothesized to contribute to this pathophysiologic process. This study investigated whether the immunoreactivity of AGEs is higher in patients with idiopathic frozen shoulder than in the control groups. METHODS: Shoulder capsule samples were collected from 8 patients with idiopathic frozen shoulder, 6 with unstable shoulders (control 1), and 8 with rotator cuff tears (control 2). The samples were hematoxylin and eosin stained and analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against AGEs. Immunoreactivities were rated in a blinded fashion from none (0) to strong (3). Immunohistochemical distribution within the capsule was noted. RESULTS: Frozen shoulder patients had greater frequency and severity of self-reported pain (Pâ=â.02) than rotator cuff tear patients and more restricted range of motion in all planes (Pâ<â.05) than patients of the instability and rotator cuff tear groups. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained capsular tissue from frozen shoulder showed fibroblastic proliferation, increased numbers of adipocytes, and increased subsynovial vascularity. Immunoreactivity of AGEs was stronger in frozen shoulder capsules (2.8) than in instability (0.3; Pâ=â.0001) and rotator cuff tear (1.1; Pâ=â.016) capsules. CONCLUSION: This study highlights a potential role for AGEs in the pathogenesis of frozen shoulder. The overexpression of AGEs may explain the fibroblastic proliferation and deposition of collagen matrix in idiopathic frozen shoulder. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Basic Science Study; Histology.Muscle stiffness estimated using shear wave elastography can provide an index of individual muscle force during isometric contraction and may therefore be a promising method for quantifying co-contraction. We estimated the shear modulus of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle using supersonic shear wave imaging and measured its myoelectrical activity using surface electromyography (sEMG) during graded isometric contractions of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion (n=7). During dorsiflexion, the average shear modulus was 26Â±6kPa at peak sEMG amplitude, which was significantly less (P=0.02) than that measured at the same sEMG level during plantar flexion (42Â±10kPa). The passive tension during contraction was estimated using the passive LG muscle shear modulus during a passive ankle rotation measured at an equivalent ankle angle to that measured during contraction. The passive shear modulus increased significantly (P<0.01) from the plantar flexed position (16Â±5kPa) to the dorsiflexed position (26Â±9kPa). Once this change in passive tension from joint rotation was accounted for, the average LG muscle shear modulus due to active contraction was significantly greater (P<0.01) during plantar flexion (26Â±8kPa) than at sEMG-matched levels of dorsiflexion (0Â±4kPa). The negligible shear modulus estimated during isometric dorsiflexion indicates negligible active force contribution by the LG muscle, despite measured sEMG activity of 19% of maximal voluntary plantar flexion contraction. This strongly suggests that the sEMG activity recorded from the LG muscle during isometric dorsiflexion was primarily due to cross-talk. However, it is clear that passive muscle tension changes can contribute to joint torque during isometric dorsiflexion.The breast surgery has undergone changes in recent years, encouraging new initiatives for the anaesthetic management of these patients in order to achieve maximum quality and rapid recovery. The fundamental tool that has allowed a significant improvement in the progress of regional anaesthesia for breast disease has been ultrasound, boosting the description and introduction into clinical practice of interfascial chest wall blocks, although the reference standard is still the paravertebral block. It is very likely that these blocks will change the protocols in the coming years. A review is presented of the anatomy of the breast region, description of nerve blocks and techniques, as well as their indications, all according to published articles and the opinion of the authors based on their experience.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Despite undergoing complex brachial plexus, surgical reconstructions, and rehabilitation, some patients request an elective amputation. This study evaluates the role of elective amputation after brachial plexus injury. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for all the 2140 patients with brachial plexus injuries treated with elective amputation between 1999 and 2012 at a single institution. Analysis was conducted on the potential predisposing factors for amputation, amputation level, and postamputation complications. Patients were evaluated using pre- and postamputation Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm, and hand scores in addition to visual analog pain scores. RESULTS: The following three conditions were observed in all nine patients who requested an elective amputation: (1) Pan-plexus injury; (2) non-recovery (mid-humeral amputation) or elbow flexion recovery only (forearm amputation) 1 year after all other surgical options were performed; and (3) at least one chronic complication (chronic infection, nonunion fractures, full-thickness burns, chronic neck pain with arm weight, etc.). Pain improvement was found in five patients. Subjective patient assessments and visual analog pain scores before and after amputation did not show a statistically significant improvement in Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm, and Hand Scores. However, four patients reported that their shoulder pain felt "better" than it did before the amputation, and two patients indicated they were completely cured of chronic pain after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Elective amputation after brachial plexus injury should be considered as an option in the above circumstances. When the informed and educated decision is made, patients can have satisfactory outcomes regarding amputation.Clinical results of a percutaneous needle trigger digit release (PNTDR) technique using a 25-gauge needle with corticosteroid infiltration are reported. This prospective study assessed 52 digits that underwent PNTDR. Experimental results were compared with those of a control group with only steroid injection. Patients who underwent PNTDR were divided into diabetic and nondiabetic groups, and assessed after 1 week, and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months post surgery. The quick disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire and visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain were completed both before and after surgery. PNTDR showed better statistical results than the control group. At final follow-up, 94% of patients were rated as excellent or good, recurrence was observed in 3 digits, and QuickDASH and VAS score significantly decreased. This technique was equally effective in patients with moderate or well-controlled diabetes with favorable results.OBJECTIVE: Access-related hand ischemia (ARHI) is a potentially limb-threatening complication of arteriovenous access for dialysis. The distal revascularization-interval ligation (DRIL) and revision using distal inflow (RUDI) procedures both allow treatment of ischemic symptoms while maintaining fistula patency. Although outcomes with the DRIL are well established, experience with the RUDI for ARHI remains preliminary. We compared outcomes in these procedures with respect to cumulative patency, resolution of symptoms, and patient survival. METHODS: A large, prospectively maintained database was used to identify all patients after autogenous arteriovenous fistula construction at two hospitals between 2005 and 2015. Patients with severe Society for Vascular Surgery grade 3 ARHI were included for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2035 autogenous accesses were created during the study period, and 58 (3%) developed grade 3 ARHI. Of this cohort, RUDI was performed in 20 and DRIL in 21. The indication for intervention was tissue loss (61%) or ischemic rest pain (39%). Mean age was 57.5Â years, and 54% of patients were female. Most patients had diabetes (86%) and symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (63%). The mean preoperative digital-brachial index was 0.25Â Â± 0.12. There were no preoperative differences in patient comorbidities between the RUDI and DRIL cohorts. Primary patency between the RUDI and DRIL cohorts at 12Â months (58%Â Â± 11% vs 55%Â Â± 12%) and 36Â months (51%Â Â± 12% vs 41%Â Â± 12%) were similar (PÂ = .841). Cumulative secondary patency at 12Â months (84%Â Â± 8% vs 94%Â Â± 6%) and 36Â months (78%Â Â± 9% vs 86%Â Â± 9%) showed no significant difference (PÂ = .398). Resolution of ischemic symptoms, including resolution or improvement in pain or healing of ischemic ulcers or amputations, occurred in 90% with RUDI and in 81% with DRIL (PÂ = .131). Survival for patients who underwent RUDI or DRIL procedures at 1 and 3Â years was 85% vs 86% (PÂ = .948) and 55% vs 49% (PÂ = .278). CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, the RUDI demonstrated similar patency, symptom resolution, and survival compared with the DRIL for patients with severe ARHI. All-cause mortality after any procedure for severe steal syndrome is high, and the particular intervention for management of steal must account for anatomic-, patient-, and disease-related considerations.PMID: 26776748  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]OBJECTIVES: The aim was to review the pediatric cohort undergoing surgical exploration for acute scrotal pain at our institution and assess the entity of chronic orchalgia post exploration in this cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all pediatric patients who underwent surgery for acute scrotal pain at a single institution between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2012 was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 1084 patients underwent scrotal exploration for acute scrotal pain where the underlying cause could not be clinically ascertained. Causes found at exploratory surgery are shown in the table. Forty-four children (4.1%) re-presented with another episode of acute scrotal pain and underwent re-exploration. A hundred of the 772 children with testicular appendage torsion at initial exploration had unilateral exploration only. Seven (7%) of these re-presented with contralateral appendage torsion. The complication rate of initial scrotal exploration was 5.6% and that of re-exploration was 6.8%. All complications were managed conservatively except for a painful reactive hydrocele that underwent the Jaboulay procedure. Fifteen (1.4%) children in this cohort developed chronic orchalgia. Thirteen (87%) of these had definite pathology found at initial exploration. One of 61 (2%) with postoperative complications (a reactive hydrocele) developed chronic orchalgia. Pediatric chronic pain specialists were consulted for all patients. In 10 of the 15 (67%), significant comorbidities included constipation, anxiety, somatization, hydrocele, dysfunctional voiding, and multiple joint pain. The Jaboulay procedure for reactive hydrocele and re-exploration to pex the testes due to suspected intermittent testicular torsion resolved chronic orchalgia in one patient each. DISCUSSION: Pediatric chronic orchalgia post exploration is uncommon. It has a multifactorial etiology. Comorbidities are common. It is possible that some unexplored patients labeled as chronic orchalgia in the literature may have underlying correctable pathology. Surgically correctable pathology such as intermittent testicular torsion, metachronous testicular appendage torsion, and symptomatic hydrocele or varicocele should be excluded in children with chronic orchalgia. Chronic pain specialists should be consulted and associated comorbidities managed. Prior surgical exploration and testicular fixation in children with chronic orchalgia helped reassure patients and families that there was no underlying surgical cause for the pain and facilitated compliance with chronic pain management. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric chronic orchalgia has a multifactorial etiology and is uncommon after scrotal exploration surgery. Comorbidities are common and must be managed. Surgical exploration helps reassure patients that there is no correctable cause for the pain and facilitates engagement with chronic pain management.PMID: 26776740  [PubMed - in process]PMID: 26776739  [PubMed - in process]Chronic pain due to insulin injections and the self-monitoring of blood glucose is a daily reality for children and adolescents with diabetes. Support groups are organised by the nurse who gives personalised advice to young patients and their parents, in order to relieve the pain and overcome any difficulties.OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive surgical staging via laparoscopy provides improved perioperative outcomes and quality of life in endometrial cancer patients when compared to laparotomy. These data for following robotic surgery for endometrial cancer are limited. Thus, the purpose of this study was to measure and compare postoperative pain and patient satisfaction in patients undergoing either robotic or open laparotomy for surgical staging of endometrial cancer. DESIGN: Patients scheduled for surgical staging of endometrial cancer at a single institution were identified for this prospective, comparative study. The decision to pursue one of two operative approaches (robotic versus laparotomy) was made by the faculty physician prior to enrollment. Patients participated in the study for up to 48 hours for pain assessments, and up to 10 +/- 3 days postoperatively for quality of recovery assessments. DESIGN CLASSIFICATION: II- Evidence obtained from a well-designed controlled trial without randomization. SETTING: Patients enrolled in this study were either undergoing robotic or open laparotomy for surgical staging of endometrial cancer. PATIENTS: 142 subjects were enrolled in this study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent either robotic or open hysterectomies for staging of endometrial cancer MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The following measurements were performed: postoperative pain with the visual analog scale, 24 hours opioid consumption, and quality of recovery using the Quality of Recovery Questionnaire. The study was terminated due to futility, given the lack of open procedures at our Institution. Despite no statistical significant difference between Visual Analog Scores (VAS) at rest and with leg extension, there was a significant decrease in 24 hour opioid consumption in the robotic group. In addition, the Quality of Recovery Questionnaire (QoR40) showed an increased perception of recovery in patients within the robotic group when compared to the laparotomy group. CONCLUSION: Endometrial cancer patients who underwent robotic surgery had decreased postoperative opioid consumption and improved quality of recovery compared to patients who had surgery via laparotomy.STUDY OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a surgical video where-in an isolated hemidiaphragmatic tumor nodule was resected laparoscopically in a patient with isolated recurrence of endometrial cancer. DESIGN: Case report (Canadian Task Force Classification Study Design III) SETTING: Tertiary referral center in New Haven, CT. INTERVENTIONS: This is a step-by-step illustration of tumor nodule resection from the right hemidiaphragm. Patient was a 55 year-old Caucasian woman who was diagnosed with stage IIIA endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma in June 2011 status post surgical debulking. She received adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel and vaginal brachytherapy. She was disease-free until March 2015 when she presented with right upper abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed one centimeter implant on the right hepatic dome. The implant was noted to be enlarged to 1.8 cm on a subsequent CT in August 2015. The patient was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparoscopy, resection of the hepatic dome/hemidiaphragmatic tumor nodule. The tumor nodule was noted to be involving the full thickness of the right hemidiaphragm. The resection of the entire nodule required perforation of the diaphragm which was re-approximated after the excision. The procedure was performed without any complications.Patient had an uneventful post-operative course and was discharged home on post-operative day one. Pathology revealed metastatic endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic resection of the diaphragmatic tumor nodule and the re-approximation of the diaphragm were successfully performed in this patient with isolated disease recurrence. Laparoscopic approach should be considered for management of isolated recurrences in gynecologic cancers by experienced laparoscopic surgeons, since it might otherwise be associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1-3].STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe our technique for the laparoscopic removal of Essure microinserts. DESIGN: Step-by-step explanation of the procedure using video (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING: Hysteroscopic sterilization using tubal microinsert devices has generally been reported to be well tolerated in terms of procedure-related pain. Persistent pelvic pain requiring microinsert removal have been described in a few case reports and series, and estimated at 0.16% of cases (7 cases 49 out of 4,274 ) in a large retrospective study. Removal is usually performed at patient request and or due to persistent pelvic pain unresponsive to other treatments with no other etiologies found. In general the pain starts at the initial insertion and persists thereafter .Both laparoscopic and hysteroscopic removal approaches have been described in the few cases reported. INTERVENTIONS: In this video, we describe our technique for the surgical management of pelvic pain resulting from essure microinserts . We performed a laparoscopic removal of bilateral essure microinserts in a 30 years old G3P3 with bilateral Essure devises placed 2 years prior to the procedure, with HSG confirmed appropriate placement. Patient was suffering from bilateral sharp pelvic pain since insertion, related to positional change and movements, unrelated to periods ,along with menorrhagia. A pelvic ultrasound showed a small intramural uterine leiomyoma. She failed a trial of treatment of her symptoms with levonorgestrel Intrauterine devise. Patient requested removal of her Essure microinserts and endometrial ablation procedure. She underwent a Laparoscopic bilateral Essure microinserts removal and bilateral salpingectomy ,along with Hysteroscopic removal of levonorgestrel intrauterine devise and endometrial ablation .Her surgery was uneventful and she was discharge the day of surgery.Her symptoms resolved completely after procedure. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic removal of Essure microinserts in the context of persistent pelvic pain after insertion is a feasible and effective procedure, and allows the avoidance of performing a hysterectomy when the patient declines such. Sound knowledge of the Essure components and meticulous surgical technique are paramount for successful results.STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe a technique for the laparoscopic management of a cornual ectopic pregnancy. DESIGN: Step-by-step explanation of the procedure using video (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING: Cornual pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy, accounting for up to 2% to 4% of all ectopic pregnancies, with a mortality range of 2.0% to 2.5% and this accounts for 20% of all deaths due to ectopic pregnancies.Both medical and surgical treatments have been reported.While laparotomy hysterectomy and cornuectomy used to be the preferred surgical approaches,more cornual ectopic pregnancies are being managed with the laparoscopic approach through cornuostomy or cornuectomy in the recent years.The main concern with surgical treatment is hemorrhage and the need for cornual reconstruction which necessitate advanced laparoscopic skills and technique. INTERVENTIONS: In this video, we describe our technique for the treatment of a cornual ectopic pregnancy.We present the case of a 21 years old G3P2002 with the finding of a right live cornual ectopic pregnancy with gestational age of 6 weeks on pelvic Ultrasound ,in the context of an elevated HCG level at 7192 and right pelvic pain.After counseling regarding treatment options the patient agreed with proceeding with surgery and underwent a laparoscopic right cornuectomy.Her surgery was uneventful and she was discharged home a few hours after surgery and was completely recovered at her post-operative follow up visit.Her serial serum HCG levels were followed until complete resolution a few weeks later. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic cornuectomy is a safe and effective procedure for the management of cornual ectopic pregnancy .The use of hemostatic agents and suturing can help prevent hemorrhage and allows a safe removal of the ectopic pregnancy and repair of the uterine defect created.PMID: 26776658  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]The etiology of ankle osteoarthritis (OA) is largely unknown. We analyzed 24 ankle OA of 21 patients diagnosed by plain radiographs using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ankle joint pain disappeared in 22 out of 24 joints by conservative treatment. MRI bone signal changes in and around the ankle joints were observed in 22 of 24 joints. Bone signal changes along the joint line were seen in 10 of 11 joints as a Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of II to IV. Such signal changes were witnessed in only 4 of 13 joints with KL grade 0 or I. In the talocrural joint, bone alterations occurred in both tibia and talus bones through the joint line in cases of KL grade III or IV, while focal bone alterations were present in the talus only in KL grade I or II cases. Sixteen of 24 joints exhibited intraosseous bone signal changes, which tended to correspond to joint pain of any ankle OA stage. Our results suggest that bone alterations around the ankle joint might be one of the etiologies of OA and associated with ankle joint pain.PMID: 26776545  [PubMed - in process]PMID: 26776324  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the impact of a booklet integrating the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain management on reducing disability among patients undergoing lumbar discetomy. METHODS: In a prospective, controlled, time-series study with an alternate-month design, we enrolled 129 patients from a tertiary care university hospital after they underwent uncomplicated lumbar discectomy for the first time. The intervention group received the biopsychosocial evidence-based booklet and the control group a biomedical-based booklet; the booklets differed only in information content. Patients were blinded to treatment group. The main outcome was disability at 2 months (measured by the Quebec back-pain disability scale [QBPDS]). Secondary outcomes were fear and avoidance beliefs measured by the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ). All data were collected by self-reporting questionnaires. RESULTS: At 2 months, disability did not differ between the 2 groups (QBPDS score 32.4Â±22.8 vs 36.1Â±18.7, P=0.36). FABQ physical activity score was lower with the evidenced-based booklet as compared with controls (8.0Â±7.14 vs 11.2Â±6.3, P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Providing an evidence-based booklet had no effect at 2 months after surgery on disability but reduced fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity. This booklet could be an effective tool for health care professionals in helping with patient education. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00761111.PMID: 26776236  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]Dientamoeba fragilis is now considered a potentially emerging gastrointestinal pathogen in both developing and developed countries. We first report an autochthonous case of D. fragilis infection in Greece. A 49-year-old female with acute non-specific abdominal pain required emergency surgical admission for active observation and repeated assessment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of acute unexplained abdominal pain finally attributed to D. fragilis infection using microscopic and molecular methods.Oculomycosis is a major cause of visual impairment. Eye pain, redness, discharge, diminution and photophobia are presenting features. We collected corneal scraping, vitreous, aqueous fluids and conjunctival swabs after the slit-lamp examination. Ophthalmological findings were hypopyon, stromal congestion, conjunctival congestion and epithelial defect. Direct microscopy of 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mounts, gram staining, fungal and bacterial cultures were performed. Fungal isolates were obtained in 24% patients with equal number of both sexes and average age 49 years. KOH revealed fungi in 73% samples and 43.33% were positive on Gram staining. Fusarium spp. (36.66%), Aspergillus spp. (23.33%) and melanised fungi (20%) were common etiological agents. Fusarium spp. was more often associated with complications. Trauma was a predisposing factor in 65% cases and occurred mainly with vegetable matter. The majority responded to the conservative management with 5% natamycin and four patients required surgery.Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a serious adverse event of anticoagulation with a high risk of thromboembolic complications. As a consequence, anticoagulants other than heparins must be administered. These may be unavailable, contraindicated during pregnancy, off-label, impractical due to short half-lives and, most importantly, may be unfamiliar to many anesthesiologists. Impaired coagulation bears the risk of adverse events following neuraxial procedures and of peripartum hemorrhage. We describe the case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in a 29-year old pregnant woman at 27weeks of gestation with severe valvular heart disease.We present a case of accidental injection of tranexamic acid during spinal anesthesia for an elective cesarean delivery. Immediately following intrathecal injection of 2mL of solution, the patient complained of severe back pain, followed by muscle spasm and tetany. As there was no evidence of spinal block, the medications given were checked and a 'used' ampoule of tranexamic acid was found on the spinal tray. General anesthesia was induced but muscle spasm and tetany persisted despite administration of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. Hemodynamic instability, ventricular tachycardia, and status epilepticus developed, which were refractory to phenytoin, diazepam, and infusions of thiopental, midazolam and amiodarone. Magnesium sulfate was administered postoperatively in the intensive care unit, following which the frequency of seizures decreased, eventually stopping. Unfortunately, on postoperative day three the patient died from cardiopulmonary arrest after an oxygen supply failure that was not associated with the initial event. This report underlines the importance of double-checking medications before injection in order to avoid a drug error. As well, it suggests that magnesium sulfate may be useful in stopping seizures caused by the intrathecal injection of tranexamic acid.INTRODUCTION: The aim of this impact study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and side effect profile of programmed intermittent epidural boluses (PIEB)+patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) to continuous epidural infusion (CEI)+PCEA for maintenance labor analgesia after the introduction of PIEB at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis after replacing the background CEI with PIEB for our labor PCEA. Pre-change pump settings were CEI 12mL/h with PCEA (12mL bolus, lockout 15min); PIEB settings were a 9mL bolus every 45min with PCEA (10mL bolus, lockout 10min). We compared medical records of all women receiving epidural or combined spinal-epidural labor analgesia for vaginal delivery for two months before PIEB implementation to a two-month period of PIEB utilization following a five-month introductory familiarization period. The primary outcome was the proportion of women requiring rescue clinician boluses. RESULTS: Fewer patients in the PIEB group required rescue clinician boluses compared to the CEI group (12% vs. 19%, P=0.012). Time to first rescue bolus request and total bolus dose were not different. Peak (median [IQR]) pain scores were 2[0-5] with CEI and 0[0-4] with PIEB. There was no difference in instrumental delivery rates. CONCLUSIONS: Using PIEB compared to CEI as the background maintenance epidural analgesia method in conjunction with PCEA reduced the number of women requiring clinician rescue boluses while providing comparable labor analgesia. The findings of this clinical care impact study confirm the results of randomized controlled studies and suggest PIEB may be a preferable technique to CEI for the maintenance of labor analgesia.Visceral pain and intestinal dysbiosis are associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a common functional gastrointestinal disorder without available efficient therapies. In this study, a decrease of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii presence has been observed in an IBS-like rodent model induced by a neonatal maternal separation (NMS) stress. Moreover, it was investigated whether F. prausnitzii may have an impact on colonic sensitivity. The A2-165 reference strain, but not its supernatant, significantly decreased colonic hypersensitivity induced by either NMS in mice or partial restraint stress in rats. This effect was associated with a reinforcement of intestinal epithelial barrier. Thus, F. prausnitzii exhibits anti-nociceptive properties, indicating its potential to treat abdominal pain in IBS patients.Infectious aortitis is a rare clinical entity that most often manifests itself by an aortic aneurysm. The syphilitic or tubercular forms can be subacute. When it is caused by Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus sp. or Streptococcus pneumoniae, the aortitis is acute with alarming symptoms. Germs found in most cases are Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. S.Â pneumoniae rarely causes infectious aortitis. We report the case of a 75-year-old patient seen in an emergency setting for sudden-onset abdominal pain with fever. An abdominal angio-computed tomography (CT) scan showed a sacciform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, with an inflammatory aspect and periaortic hematoma. Surgical cure was undertaken because of the impending rupture. An interposition aortic replacement graft was implanted. Blood cultures and bacteriological study of the aortic wall isolated a S.Â pneumoniae. The anatomical pathology study reported fibrin clot leukocyte remodeling of the aortic wall. An intravenous antibiotic regimen was started. Several organisms, including Streptococcus, can cause infectious aortitis. We found 36Â cases described in the literature in addition to our patient.PMID: 26775784  [PubMed - in process]Dysesthesia is a generic term for a cutaneous symptom-such as pruritus, burning, tingling, stinging, anesthesia, hypoesthesia, tickling, crawling, cold sensation, or even pain-without a primary cutaneous condition in a well-defined location that is often caused by nerve trauma, impingement, or irritation. There are multiple types of dysesthesias depending on the body location and the nerves involved. While location, exact symptoms, and etiologies might vary, the underlying theme is that these conditions are of neurologic origin and have dermatologic consequences. For many of these conditions, the symptoms are localized to the skin, and patients frequently present to the dermatologist; it is important for dermatologists to be knowledgeable about these symptoms and their underlying causes. In part II of this continuing medical education review, the primary diagnoses associated with underlying cutaneous dysesthesias will be explored, including scalp dysesthesia, trigeminal trophic syndrome, meralgia paresthetica, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. The typical demographics in terms of symptoms, location, and patient populations will be discussed in addition to the specific etiologies, workups, and possible treatment options.Few sources of information exist regarding cutaneous innervation and how to apply this basic neurologic science to the clinical treatment of itch, as often performed on a daily basis by dermatologists. We address the types of nerve fibers that innervate the skin and their different components and discuss the similarities and differences between itch and pain. We hope that increased knowledge of this topic will improve the recognition and treatment of neuropathic itch.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the outcome of open inferior capsular shift for multidirectional shoulder instability in patients with generalized ligamentous hyperlaxity or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. METHODS: Data were obtained for 18 open inferior capsular shift surgeries in 15 adolescent patients with generalized ligamentous hyperlaxity or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with a mean follow-up of 7.5 years. End points were subjective clinical outcome (pain, stability, satisfaction, return to sport), objective clinical outcome (recurrence, complications), and functional outcome scores (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, 11-item version of the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand). RESULTS: Thirteen patients (87%) reported improved pain and stability and were satisfied with the procedure. Nine patients (64%) were able to return to sports. One patient (7%) was dissatisfied with continuous pain and recurrent instability and considered a surgical failure. Seven patients (47%) reported no further episodes of instability. The mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score at a mean of 7.5 years of follow-up was 88âÂ±â10 points, and the mean score for the 11-item version of the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand was 14âÂ±â14 points. DISCUSSION: The management of multidirectional shoulder instability in adolescent patients with generalized ligamentous hyperlaxity or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is challenging. Open inferior capsular shift results in improvement in subjective and objective shoulder function and stability in adolescent patients with ligamentous hyperlaxity or Ehlers-Danlos who have failed nonoperative treatment. We found no effect of the recalled number of prior dislocations, laterality, and type of hyperlaxity on subjective and objective clinical outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV; Case Series; Treatment Study.The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) for the treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) and compare its effectiveness with that of clobetasol propionate. Four sessions of topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) were administered at 2-week intervals. Clobetasol propionate (0.05%) was used daily for 8 weeks. The rate of complete response in the PDT group (14/20) was one-fold higher than the clobetasol propionate group (7/20) (pâ<â0.05, Ï2â=â4.912). Horizontal visual analogue scores indicated that PDT was more effective than clobetasol propionate. Pain intensity numeric rating scale (PI-NRS) values for PDT were between 3.05 and 4.45. One month after the final session of PDT, only one patient relapsed. ALA-PDT is a safe and effective option for the treatment of VLS.INTRODUCTION: We report a case of a particular lumbar and radicular pain revealing primary hyperparathyroidism and discuss its characteristics through a literature review. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old woman was hospitalized for a nerve root pain associated with recent weight loss with normal physical examination. Biology showed no evidence for acute phase response and normal kidney and liver functions. However, hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia were evidenced. Radiographs of the lumbar spine showed a lytic lesion occupying the body of L4. A lumbar spine CT scan confirmed the presence of a compressive nerve root brown tumor. High level of PTH and parathyroid mass raised the possibility of the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. After parathyroidectomy all signs of hyperparathyroidism resolved with complete disappearance of spinal brown tumors in a two year follow-up CT scan. CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, brown tumor should be a diagnosis to consider in their presence of a spinal tumor. The improvement after conservative treatment could be dramatic.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rectal indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is given to prevent pancreatitis in high-risk patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), based on findings from clinical trials. European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines recently recommended prophylactic rectal indomethacin for all patients undergoing ERCP, including those at average risk for pancreatitis. We performed a randomized controlled trail to investigate the efficacy of this approach. METHODS: We performed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 449 consecutive patients undergoing ERCP at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, from March 2013 through December 2014. Approximately 70% of the cohort were at average-risk for PEP. Subjects were randomly assigned to groups given either a single 100 mg dose of rectal indomethacin (n=223) or a placebo suppository (n=226) during the procedure. The primary outcome was the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), defined by new upper-abdominal pain, a level of lipase greater than 3-fold the upper limit of normal, and hospitalization following ERCP for 2 consecutive nights. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in baseline clinical or procedural characteristics. Sixteen patients in the indomethacin group (7.2%) and 11 in the placebo group (4.9%) developed PEP (P=.33). Complications and the severity of PEP were similar between groups. Per a priori protocol guidelines, the study was stopped due to futility. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized controlled study of consecutive patients undergoing ERCP, rectal indomethacin did not prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis. ClincialTrials.gov no: NCT01774604.BACKGROUND: The main goal of this study was to assess iatrogenic subchondral bone lesions following three different anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction techniques and their association with early postoperative pain. METHODS: A multicenter prospective comparative study was conducted in 2012. Each center performed a specific ligamentoplasty technique: two used retrograde and the other antegrade tibial tunnel drilling. Peri- and postoperative analgesia and systematic early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols were standardized. The main assessment criterion was tibial subchondral lesions (microfractures or bone oedema) on MRI during the first postoperative week. Secondary criteria were the assessment of postoperative pain for two days using a Visual Analogical Scale (VAS 0-10) and consumption of analgesics. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included in three centers, 15 in the "antegrade group" and 28 in the "retrograde group", mean age is 32.5Â±9.1years, 14 women/29 men. All included patients underwent postoperative MRI. There were no subchondral tibial microfractures, but oedema was significantly more frequent in the antegrade group (p=0.0001). Tibial subchondral oedema was correlated to greater early postoperative pain (p=0.01). Multivariate analysis identified tibial tunnel diameter as an independent factor of early postoperative pain. The smaller the tibial tunnel diameter, the greater the mean early postoperative pain (â¤8mm (18 patients) 3.4Â±1.5 vs. >8mm (25 patients) 1.8Â±1.7, p=0.004) and the more frequent the presence of edemas (10/18 vs. 2/25, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: The present clinical study confirmed the benefit of retrograde tibial tunnel drilling for tibial subchondral bone lesions and showed a correlation between these lesions and early postoperative pain. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II; therapeutic study - prospective cohort study.BACKGROUND: Individuals with patellofemoral pain present with altered hip muscle activation, faulty movement patterns, and pain during functional tasks. Examining new treatment options to address these impairments may better treat those with patellofemoral pain. The purpose of this study was to determine if patterned electrical stimulation to the lower extremity affects muscle activity, movement patterns, and pain following a single treatment. METHODS: Fifteen females with patellofemoral pain were randomized to receive a single 15-minute treatment of either a patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation or a sham. Peak kinematics of the knee, hip, and trunk, electromyography and pain were examined pre and post-intervention during a single leg squat and lateral step-down task. Group means and pre/post reduced kinematic values were also plotted during the entire task with 90% confidence intervals to identify differences in movement strategies. FINDINGS: No baseline differences were found in peak kinematics between groups. No pre to post-intervention differences in peak knee, hip and trunk kinematics were found, however differences were seen when the quality of movement across the entire tasks was assessed. The electrical stimulation group had improved knee flexion and hip abduction during the lateral step-down. A significant improvement in gluteus medius activation following patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation occurred during the step-down (P=0.039). Significant pain improvements were also seen in both the single leg squat (P=0.025) and lateral step-down (P=0.006). INTERPRETATION: A single treatment of patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation improved muscle activation, lower extremity kinematics during functional tasks, and pain.BACKGROUND: In distal pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), distal pancreatectomy with en bloc splenectomy and celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) can allow curative resection in case of tumor extension to celiac axis. METHODS: From 2008 to 2013, of 102Â patients with localized distal PDAC, 7Â patients with celiac axis involvement were planned to undergo DP-CAR with curative intent. All patients received neoadjuvant treatment followed by preoperative coil embolization to enlarge collateral arterial pathways, except if a replaced right hepatic artery arising from superior mesenteric artery was present and sufficient for the blood supply. We herein analyzed indications, technique and outcomes of DP-CAR. RESULTS: After neoadjuvant treatment and arterial embolization, two patients experienced tumor progression and were not operated while five underwent DP-CAR. No patient required arterial reconstruction. Postoperative mortality was nil, but morbidity was 100%, mainly represented by pancreatic fistula. Postoperatively, there was a complete pain relief but chronic diarrhea was observed in all patients. Resections were R0 in three patients. One operated patient was alive and disease free at 60Â months whereas median overall survival of patients who underwent resection was 24Â months. CONCLUSIONS: DP-CAR for borderline resectable/locally advanced distal PDAC is associated with high morbidity and mixed long-term functional results. Neoadjuvant treatment may prevent from unnecessary surgery for patients with progressive disease and may facilitate resection with acceptable long-term survival.BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by an insult or dysfunction in the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS), the main symptoms being mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia. NP often shows insufficient response to classic analgesics and its management remains a challenge. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method of cerebral stimulation and represents a promising resource for pain management. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We investigated the effects of tDCS on the nociceptive response and on IL-1Î², IL-10, and TNF-Î± levels in CNS structures of rats with NP. METHODS: After induction of NP by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, the rats received 20âmin of bicephalic tDCS for 8âdays. Hyperalgesia was assessed by the hot plate and von Frey tests and evaluated at baseline, 7âdays, and 14âdays after CCI surgery, and also immediately, 24âhours, and 7âdays following tDCS treatment. The levels of IL-1Î², IL-10 and TNF-Î± in the cortex, spinal cord, and brainstem were determined by ELISA at 48âhours and 7âdays post-tDCS. RESULTS: The CCI model provoked thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia until at least 30âdays post-CCI; however, bicephalic tDCS relieved the nociceptive behavior for up to 7âdays after treatment completion. CONCLUSIONS: Bicephalic tDCS is effective to promote antinociceptive behavior in neuropathic pain, which can be reflected by a spinal neuroimmunomodulation linked to pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels observed in the long-term.BACKGROUND: Approximately 8% of all pregnant women experience a traumatic injury during pregnancy. There has been no evaluation of a state trauma system's effect on birth outcomes. This study examined the association of treatment in a designated trauma hospital vs a nontrauma hospital on maternal and neonatal outcomes among injured pregnant patients in Washington State. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study (1995 to 2012). The Washington State Birth Events Records Database and the Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Recording System were linked to ascertain all hospitalized injured pregnant patients. The cohort was dichotomized by exposure to trauma vs nontrauma hospitals. We analyzed the association between trauma hospital designation and risk of adverse birth outcomes using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95% CI, adjusting for Injury Severity Score and other confounders. RESULTS: We ascertained 3,429 injured pregnant women. Patients treated in trauma hospitals had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.50-0.73) for preterm labor, aORÂ = 0.74 (95% CI, 0.57-0.96) for gestational age <37 weeks, aORÂ = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54-0.97) for birth weight <2,500 g, and aORÂ = 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39-0.76) for meconium at delivery. No statistically significant associations were found for maternal death (aORÂ = 2.57; 95% CI, 0.32-20.38), fetal death (aORÂ = 1.60; 95% CI, 0.35-7.35), or neonatal death (aORÂ = 1.50; 95% CI, 0.50-4.49). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of injured pregnant women at designated trauma hospitals was associated with several improved birth outcomes. Trauma hospital treatment, with a greater focus on maternal resuscitation and monitoring, might explain these findings.BACKGROUND: Labour pain is a major concern for women, their partners and maternity health care professionals. However, little is known about Dutch midwives' perceptions of working with women experiencing labour pain. The aim of this study was to explore midwives' perceptions of supporting women in dealing with pain during labour. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative focus group study with four focus groups, including a total of 23 midwives from 23 midwifery practices across the country. Purposive sampling was used to select the practices. The constant comparison method of Glaser and Straus (1967, ren. 1995) was used to gain an understanding of midwives' perceptions regarding labour pain management. RESULTS: We found two main themes. The first theme concerned the midwives' experienced professional role conflict, which was reflected in their approach of labour pain management along a spectrum from "working with pain" to a "pain relief" approach. The second theme identified situational factors, including time constraints; discontinuity of care; role of the partner; and various cultural influences, that altered the context in which care was provided and how midwives saw their professional role. CONCLUSION: Midwives felt challenged by the need to balance their professional attitude towards normal birth and labour pain, which favours working with pain, with the shift in society towards a wider acceptance of pharmacological pain management during labour. This shift compelled them to redefine their professional identity.PMID: 26775135  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]Sleep-wake behavior is altered in response to immune challenge. Although the precise mechanisms that govern sickness-induced changes in sleep are not fully understood, interleukin-1Î² (IL-1) is one mediator of these responses. To better understand mechanisms underlying sleep and inflammatory responses to immune challenge, we used two transgenic mouse strains that express IL-1 receptor 1 (IL1R1) only in the central nervous system and selectively on neurons or astrocytes. Electroencephalographic recordings from transgenic and wild-type mice reveal that systemic challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fragments sleep, suppresses rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), increases non-REMS (NREMS), diminishes NREM delta power, and induces fever in all genotypes. However, the magnitude of REMS suppression is greater in mice expressing IL1R1 on astrocytes compared with mice in which IL1R1 is selectively expressed on neurons. Furthermore, there is a delayed increase in NREM delta power when IL1R1 is expressed on astrocytes. LPS-induced sleep fragmentation is reduced in mice expressing IL1R1 on neurons. Although LPS increases IL-1 and IL-6 in brain of all genotypes, this response is attenuated when IL1R1 is expressed selectively on neurons or on astrocytes. Collectively, these data suggest that in these transgenic mice under the conditions of this study it is neuronal IL1R1 that plays a greater role in LPS-induced suppression of REMS and NREM delta power, whereas astroglial IL1R1 is more important for sleep fragmentation after this immune challenge. Thus, aspects of central responses to LPS are modulated by IL1R1 in a cell type-specific manner. GLIA 2016.BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic needling of a rotator cuff calcification is a highly reliable operation in terms of pain relief and return of function. However, during the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the evolution of this defect. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. Patients were randomized to either group 1 (PRP, nâ=â20) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], nâ=â20). Patients in group 1 received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the rotator cuff defect, whereas the control group did not. Patients were assessed clinically preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 year. The Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as outcome measures. The evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and 6 months and with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year. RESULTS: All patients improved significantly after surgery (Pâ<â.05). There was no difference in clinical outcome or rotator cuff healing between groups. We observed a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both groups. The presence of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic needling is an operation with a predictive, good clinical outcome. We found a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year. This study could not identify any beneficial effect of the addition of PRP on rotator cuff healing. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II; Randomized Controlled Trial; Treatment Study.BACKGROUND: Although thigh pain is an annoying problem after total hip arthroplasty (THA), little information has been known about its natural course. METHODS: To determine the frequency, time of onset, and duration of thigh pain after cementless THA, we evaluated 240 patients (240 hips) who underwent primary THA because of femoral head osteonecrosis with the use of a single tapered stem. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (11.3%) experienced thigh pain during the follow-up of 3-11 years (mean, 84 months). The pain developed 2-78 months (median, 25 months) after THA. The 75% of pain developed within 36 months. In 25 patients, the pain disappeared postoperatively 1 month-64 months (mean, 17.4 months), and 2 patients (7.4%, 2/27) had persistent thigh pain. There were no differences in the latest Harris Hip Score between the thigh pain group and no thigh pain group. CONCLUSION: Our results provided basic information about the natural history of thigh pain after cementless THA with a tapered stem design.BACKGROUND: The muscle sparing total hip arthroplasty had generated a distinguishable interest, in both the patients and the surgeons, but its benefits are still often questioned. The main idea of this study was to compare the functional clinical outcome of the patients operated by the anterolateral approach with a muscle-sparing technique (modified Watson-Jones approach), and the patients operated by modified direct lateral approach without the muscle-sparing technique (Bauer/Hardinge approach). METHODS: The patients (NÂ =Â 130) were divided into two groups: 68 in a standard method group (STAND) and 62 patients in a muscle sparing surgery group (MSS). The hip flexibility, mobility, the strength of the hip abduction, the pain scale, Harris hip scores, the duration of the hospital stay and the overall satisfaction were measured seven days, three months, one year and three years (in 80 patients) after the surgery. There were no differences in any of the parameters between the groups prior to the procedure. RESULTS: The statistically significant differences in first three follow-ups (up to one year) were determined between the groups in passive and active hip flexion ability but the hip abduction strength, which is a crucial parameter for functional recovery, and 50Â m walk test remained better in MSS group even after three years. Patients, who underwent MSS suffered also less pain, stayed in hospital shorter and were more satisfied with the operation outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The functional recovery in patients treated with muscle sparing method was faster than in patients operated with conventional lateral approach. Based on the results, we could recommend anterolateral muscle sparing approach for a total hip replacement for its faster and fuller functional recovery.Diabetes, and associated diabetic neuropathic pain, impact negatively on cognitive function. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigated neuropathic pain-related behaviour and cognitive function in the rat streptozotocin (STZ) model of diabetes, and assessed cannabinoid1 (CB1) receptor functionality in discrete brain regions. Male Lister-Hooded rats received STZ (60mg/kgs.c.) or vehicle. Sensory responses were assessed in von Frey and Hargreaves tests. Cognitive, motor and sensorimotor functions were assessed using novel object recognition and Morris water maze tasks. CB1 receptor functionality was assessed by [(35)S]GTPÎ³S (guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) autoradiography. STZ treatment was associated with mechanical allodynia and thermal hypoalgesia. Novel object recognition was unaltered in diabetic rats. STZ treatment was associated with impaired performance in the Morris water maze acquisition phase, but there were no differences in memory retrieval in the probe trial. Stimulus-response learning in the water maze cued trial was also disrupted in STZ-treated rats, possibly indicating sensorimotor deficits. CB1 receptor agonist-stimulated [(35)S]GTPÎ³S binding was attenuated in the substantia nigra of STZ-treated rats but unaltered in the hippocampus. In conclusion, STZ treatment as a model of diabetic neuropathy was associated with specific functional deficits in the MWM, effects which may be related to altered CB1 receptor functionality in the substantia nigra.Transversus abdominal plane (TAP) block is a known and useful technique, widely used for postoperative pain management of abdominal wall incisions. During the past years, and following the expansion of ultrasound guided techniques, its use has even gained more adepts. It is usually used as an adjuvant technique, primarily in order to control postoperative pain and reduce opioids consumption. We report the case of an 82 years old patient admitted for drainage of a postoperative abdominal wall hematoma after correction of a McBurney incisional hernia. The corrective surgery had gone on without incident, under general anesthesia with laryngeal mask. Two weeks later, the patient came back to our emergency department with a clear hematoma of the abdominal wall. Surgery was decided. A sole local anesthetic technique was achieved, using a TAP block. The block was performed under ultrasound guidance, using a subcostal approach. The surgery went on without complications. Therefore, TAP block offers a hemodynamic stability, appropriate intra-operative anesthesia and post-surgical analgesia of the abdominal wall.OBJECTIVES: To study the contemporary, real-world clinical and economic burden associated with angina after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Angina adversely affects quality of life and medical costs, yet data on real-world prevalence of angina following PCI and its associated economic consequences are limited. METHODS: In a multi-payer administrative claims database, we identified adults with incident inpatient PCI admissions between 2008 and 2011 who had at least 12 months of continuous medical and pharmacy benefits before and after the procedure. Patients were followed for up to 36 months. Using claims, we ascertained post-PCI outcomes: angina or chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, repeat PCI, healthcare service utilization, and costs. RESULTS: Among 51,710 study patients (mean age 61.8, 72% male), post-PCI angina or chest pain was present in 28% by 12 months and 40% by 36 months. Compared with patients who did not experience chest pain, angina or ACS, total healthcare costs in the first year after the index PCI were 1.8 times greater for patients with angina or chest pain ($32,437 vs. $17,913, Pâ<â0.001). These cost differentials continued to 36 months. CONCLUSIONS: Angina after PCI is a frequent and expensive outcome. Further research is needed to identify risk factors and potentially improve outcomes for post-PCI angina.

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented. (S)-(+)-10r is the first highly potent and selective chiral inhibitor of FAAH-COX with marked inÂ vivo activity, and represents a promising lead to discover novel analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs.The hereditary porphyrias comprise a group of eight metabolic disorders of the haem biosynthesis pathway characterised by acute neurovisceral symptoms, skin lesions or both. Each porphyria is caused by abnormal function of a separate enzymatic step resulting in a specific accumulation of haem precursors. Seven porphyrias are the consequence of a partial enzyme deficiency while a gain of function mechanism has been recently characterised in a novel porphyria. Acute porphyrias present with severe abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, confusion and seizure, which may be life threatening. Cutaneous porphyrias can be present with either acute painful photosensitivity or skin fragility and blisters. Rare recessive porphyrias usually manifest in early childhood with either severe chronic neurological symptoms or chronic haemolysis and severe cutaneous photosensitivity. Porphyrias are still underdiagnosed, but once they are suspected, and depending on the clinical presentation, a specific and simple front line test allows the diagnosis in all symptomatic patients. Diagnosis is essential to institute as soon as possible a specific treatment. Screening families to identify presymptomatic carriers is crucial to prevent chronic complications and overt disease by counselling on avoiding potential precipitants.INTRODUCTION: Distal radius fractures are common injuries that cause pain and disability. There is a clear need for biomedical engineering research to develop novel strategies to improve functional results following intra-articular distal radius fractures. However, no pharmacotherapeutic agent has been investigated to resolve this problem. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can be considered a novel additional therapy to improve the outcomes of this injury. HYPOTHESIS: Pain reduction and functional improvement can be noticed after PRP use in distal radius fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized trial study was designed with 30 patients who had intra-articular distal radius fractures (Frykman type 3, 4, 7, 8). Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning under guide of fluoroscopy were done for them. Fifteen cases received intra-articular autologus PRP. Patients were followed for 3 and 6months and "patient-rated wrist evaluation" (PRWE) questionnaire was completed and range of motion of the wrist was measured. RESULTS: The mean of pain score and the score of specific and usual activities at 3months follow-up in the case group and in the control group were (8.33 versus 19.67), (10.66 versus 26.8), and (6.2 versus 13.4), respectively. The mean of pain score and score of specific and usual activities at 6months follow-up in the case group and in the control group were (3.6 versus 12), (3 versus 15.7), and (1.2 versus 6.8), respectively. The case group was significantly different from the control group. The mean of loss of flexion and extension of the wrist at 3months follow-up in the case group was significantly different from the control group as well. CONCLUSION: PRP may have significant effect on reduction of pain and amount of difficulty in functions, including specific and usual activities after intra-articular distal radius fractures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Therapeutic trial.CASE: A patient who developed hemiplegia related to a hemorrhagic stroke and who had not been started on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis or a physical medicine and rehabilitation program was admitted to our clinic on the 4th month after the event. Our patient had pain, swelling, redness, increased temperature at the right lower extremity, range of motion limitation at the hip and knee, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) at the same side lower extremity, and heterotopic ossification (HO) at the hip. CONCLUSIONS: Our case is presented to emphasize the HO that is not frequently seen after stroke, the importance of DVT prophylaxis in hemorrhagic stroke, and the association between DVT, HO, and CRPS.BACKGROUND: There are a lot of different causes of abdominal pain; in this case, a young woman suffers from three diseases with similar symptoms. Adult intestinal mal-rotation is a rare condition of deviation from the normal 270Â° counter clockwise rotation of the midgut resulting in, not only mal-position of the small intestine, but also mal-fixation of the mesentery. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease; it involves liver capsule inflammation associated with genital tract infection, which is usually caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis. Neuroendocrine tumors are enterochromaffin cell neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems; the appendicular one is the most common primary malignant lesion of these tumors, it's incidence is about 0.3 - 0.9Â % of appendectomies done. Just for knowledge, this is the first described case of concomitant presence of all these diseases with clinical symptoms attributable to each one. CASE PRESENTATION: 40-years-old woman suffers from acute abdominal pain, predominantly on the right quadrants, without abdominal distension, no guarding nor rigidity and normal intestinal peristalsis. She has a long history of abdominal intermittent pain, with cramps every 30-40Â min, resolving spontaneously. She was diagnosed as intestinal mal-rotation through computed tomography scan which has evidenced a mobilized intra - peritoneal duodenum with cecum/ascending colon predominately lying on the left side and the small intestine almost entirely lying on the right side of abdomen, without evidence of effusion, edema or signs of intestinal ischemia or infarction. Exploratory laparoscopy demonstrated an inflammatory process in the hepatic-renal space, with bloody adhesions above the liver capsule; this is additional to the typical pelvic inflammatory disease signs (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome). Appendectomy was performed with histological analysis resulting in appendicular neuroendocrine tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Although the patient has an intestinal mal-rotation which could explain the abdominal painful symptoms, it is not possible to exclude other concomitant causes, such as perihepatitis on pelvic inflammatory disease or neuroendocrine tumors. Even if all these diseases are rarely seen in daily clinical practice, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic intermittent abdominal pain in a young woman.BACKGROUND: In placebo-controlled RCT of symptomatic treatment in osteoarthritis (OA) the extent of pain reduction is heterogeneous, the pooled effect size rather small. Pain reduction is typically higher in knee than in hip trials. The recommended trial duration is 3 months, but in knee OA the best treatment effect versus placebo is observed at two weeks. We hypothesized that the placebo response differs in knee vs. hip OA. OBJECTIVE: We performed a meta-analysis to describe the time course of pain in placebo groups of trials in knee and hip OA over three months. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE and Google Scholar of placebo-controlled coxib RCT (from 1999 to 2007) of hip and knee OA was performed. Pain levels (VAS, WOMAC) in the placebo groups at different measurement time points were extracted, expressed as weighted mean at weeks 2, 4, 6 to 8 and 12 to 13. RESULTS: 21 studies included 3,064 knee OA patients and 608 hip OA patients. For knee OA, pain (VAS) decreased from 15 mm at week 2, to 20 mm at week 6-8, and 21 mm at week 12-13. For hip OA patients, pain decreased by 12 mm, 14 mm and 14 mm, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pain decreased in both knee and hip OA patients treated with placebo at 2 weeks, but further decreases up to week 12 occurred only in knee OA, especially for pain VAS, resulting in a time dependent impact on the magnitude of treatment outcome. Primary endpoint pain should be assessed at 2 to 4 weeks.Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms with unpredictable natural history. There is a high risk of recurrence despite adequate surgical resection, however DTs do not have the capacity to metastasize. The estimated incidence in general population is 2-4 cases/million/year. They may occur at any age but most commonly in the third and fourth decades. Both sexes may be affected, but there is a slight female predominance. DTs can occur at any body site. The exact etiology remains unclear, but trauma, hormonal disturbances, pregnancy, genetic and hereditary factors are postulated to be in association with its' development. Potential to attain large size, infiltration and destruction of adjacent vital structures and tendency to recur are main management problems and important causes of morbidity and mortality. Wide excision is standard first-line treatment of primary or recurrent symptomatic desmoids. We present case of 33-years-old Caucasian female patient admitted to hospital with 2 months history of squeezing pain in right upper quadrant which appeared after meals. The patient was in general good condition. There were no abnormalities on basic laboratory tests on admission. CT of chest revealed hydrothorax to the level of the apex of the right lung and tumor sized 7 Ã 13 Ã 13 cm located in the lower lobe of right lung. Histopathological diagnosis of desmoid tumor of right lung was formulated. We report, to our knowledge for the first time in Poland, case of aggressive fibromatosis of lung with invasion of pleura.OBJECTIVE: The use of negative-pressure-wound-therapy (NPWT) is associated with improved outcomes in smaller burns. We report our experience using extra-large (XL) NPWT dressings to treat â¥15% total body surface area (TBSA) burned and describe our technique and early outcomes. We also provide NPWT exudate volume for predictive fluid resuscitation in these critically ill patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients treated with XL-NPWT from 2012 to 2014. Following excision/grafting, graft and donor sites were sealed with a layered NPWT dressing. We documented wound size, dressing size, NPWT outputs, graft take, wound infections, and length of stay (LOS). Mean NPWT exudate volume per %TBSA per day was calculated. RESULTS: Twelve burn patients (mean TBSA burned 30%, range 15-60%) were treated with XL-NPWT (dressing TBSA burned and skin graft donor sites range 17-44%). Average graft take was 97%. No wound infections occurred. Two patients had burns â¥50% TBSA and their LOS was reduced compared to ABA averages. XL-NPWT outputs peaked at day 1 after grafting followed by a steady decline until dressings were removed. Average XL-NPWT dressing output during the first 5 days was 101Â±66mL/%BSA covered per day. 2 patients developed acute kidney injury. CONCLUSION: The use of XL-NPWT to treat extensive burns is feasible with attention to application technique. NPWT dressings appear to improve graft take, and to decrease risk of infection, LOS, and pain and anxiety associated with wound care. Measured fluid losses can improve patient care in future applications of NPWT to large burn wounds.ARA 290 is an erythropoietin-derived polypeptide that possesses analgesic and tissue protective effect in many diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The analgesic effect of ARA 290 is mediated by its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions, or more specifically, by targeting the innate repair receptor (IRR) to down-regulate inflammation to alleviate neuropathic pain. However, whether other mechanisms or pathways are involved in ARA 290-mediated analgesic effect remains elusive. In this study, we are particularly interested in whether ARA 290 could directly target peripheral nociceptors by blocking or influencing receptors in pain sensation. Using calcium imaging, cell culture and behavioral tests, we demonstrated that ARA 290 was able to specifically inhibit TRPV1 channel activity, and relieve the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by capsaicin. Our study suggested that ARA 290 could potentially function as a novel antagonist for TRPV1 channel. This finding would not only contribute to the development of new pain treatment using ARA 290, but also help to improve our understanding of the integration between the immune system and the peripheral nervous system.Pain is the most common reason for patients seeking medical care resulting in an estimated world market for analgesics of more than USD 50billion. Pain is a highly complex, heterogeneous and dynamic process characterized by specific patterns of phenotypic sensory neuronal change. Current treatment options for pain include opioids and non-opioid analgesics, acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other drug classes such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants and a combination thereof. Novel approaches are focusing on the optimization of side-effect profiles of opioid based analgesics, the improvement of selectivity for specific opioid receptors, or by addressing molecular gateways implicated in pain. Promising candidates in development target various types of voltage-gated ion channels and receptors for capsaicin and analogs. Currently, after decades of pain research it has to be stated that the assessment, prevention and treatment of pain in industrialized countries as well as in low-income and middle-income countries are neither adequate nor equitable. Further research is needed so that specifically chronic pain control can be improved and individualized.The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a biodegradable, lidocaine-embedded, nanofibrous membrane for the sustainable analgesic release onto fragments of a segmental femoral fracture site. Membranes of three different lidocaine concentrations (10%, 30%, and 50%) were produced via an electrospinning technique. In vitro lidocaine release was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. A femoral segmental fracture, with intramedullary Kirschner-wire fixation and polycaprolactone stent enveloping the fracture site, was set-up in a rabbit model for in vivo assessment of post-operative recovery of activity. Eighteen rabbits were randomly assigned to three groups (six rabbits per group): group A comprised of rabbits with femoral fractures and underwent fixation; group B comprised of a comparable fracture model to that of group A with the implantation of lidocaine-loaded nanofibers; and group C, the control group, received only anesthesia. The following variables were measured: change in body weight, food and water intake before and after surgery, and total activity count post-surgery. All membranes eluted effective levels of lidocaine for more than 3 weeks post-surgery. Rabbits in group B showed faster recovery of activity post-operatively, compared with those in group A, which confirmed the pain relief efficacy of the lidocaine-embedded nanofibers. Nanofibers with sustainable lidocaine release have adequate efficacy and durability for pain relief in rabbits with segmental long bone fractures.BACKGROUND: Three-quarters of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans enrolled in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care are overweight or obese. The VHA MOVE!Â® weight management program can mitigate the risks of obesity-related morbidity. However, many Iraq and Afghanistan veterans experience barriers to VHA services, which may affect participation, especially among those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression. Little is known about MOVE! engagement among recent veterans. We describe a retrospective evaluation of MOVE! participation among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with and without mental health problems. METHODS: As part of a national VHA mental health evaluation study, we accessed VHA patient care databases to identify Iraq and Afghanistan veterans receiving care from 2008-2013 who had â¥1 MOVE! visit(s) and â¥1 weight measurements (N=24,899). We used logistic regression to determine whether mental health conditions were associated with having 12 visits/year (desirable dose of care), adjusting for demographic, health, and utilization factors. RESULTS: Among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans enrolled in MOVE!, 4% had a desirable dose of participation. In adjusted models, desirable MOVE! participation was more likely among those without PTSD; those who were older, female, and unmarried; and those who had higher baseline weight, more medical comorbidities, no pain, psychotropic medication use, higher disability ratings, and more mental health visits. LIMITATIONS: We used administrative ICD-9 codes. Sample only included veterans in VHA care. CONCLUSIONS: Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, particularly those with PTSD, had low participation in VHA weight management programming. Correlates of MOVE! participation were identified, highlighting opportunities to tailor MOVE! to improve participation for these veterans.BACKGROUND: Enzalutamide is an oral androgen-receptor inhibitor that has been shown to improve survival in two placebo-controlled phase 3 trials, and is approved for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The objective of the TERRAIN study was to compare the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide with bicalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: TERRAIN was a double-blind, randomised phase 2 study, that recruited asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic men with prostate cancer progression on androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) from academic, community, and private health-care provision sites across North America and Europe. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive enzalutamide 160 mg/day or bicalutamide 50 mg/day, both taken orally, in addition to ADT, until disease progression. Patients were stratified by a permutated block method (block size of four), by whether bilateral orchiectomy or receipt of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist therapy started before or after the diagnosis of metastases, and by study site. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, analysed in all randomised patients. Safety outcomes were analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The open-label period of the trial is in progress, wherein patients still on treatment at the end of the double-blind treatment period were offered open-label enzalutamide at the discretion of the patient and study investigator. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01288911. FINDINGS: Between March 22, 2011, and July 11, 2013, 375 patients were randomly assigned, 184 to enzalutamide and 191 to bicalutamide. 126 (68%) and 168 (88%) patients, respectively, discontinued their assigned treatment before study end, mainly due to progressive disease. Median follow-up time was 20Â·0 months (IQR 15Â·0-25Â·6) in the enzalutamide group and 16Â·7 months (10Â·2-21Â·9) in the bicalutamide group. Patients in the enzalutamide group had significantly improved median progression-free survival (15Â·7 months [95% CI 11Â·5-19Â·4]) compared with patients in the bicalutamide group (5Â·8 months [4Â·8-8Â·1]; hazard ratio 0Â·44 [95% CI 0Â·34-0Â·57]; p<0Â·0001). Of the most common adverse events, those occurring more frequently with enzalutamide than with bicalutamide were fatigue (51 [28%] of 183 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 38 [20%] of 189 in the bicalutamide group), back pain (35 [19%] vs 34 [18%]), and hot flush (27 [15%] vs 21 [11%]); those occurring more frequently with bicalutamide were nausea (26 [14%] vs 33 [17%]), constipation (23 [13%] vs 25 [13%]), and arthralgia (18 [10%] vs 30 [16%]). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the enzalutamide or bicalutamide treatment groups, respectively, were hypertension (13 [7%] vs eight [4%]), hydronephrosis (three [2%] vs seven [4%]), back pain (five [3%] vs three [2%]), pathological fracture (five [3%] vs two [1%]), dyspnoea (four [2%] vs one [1%]), bone pain (one [1%] vs four [2%]), congestive cardiac failure (four [2%] vs two [1%]), myocardial infarction (five [3%] vs none), and anaemia (four [2%] vs none]). Serious adverse events were reported by 57 (31%) of 183 patients and 44 (23%) of 189 patients in the enzalutamide and bicalutamide groups, respectively. One of the nine deaths in the enzalutamide group was thought to be possibly related to treatment (due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome) compared with none of the three deaths in the bicalutamide group. INTERPRETATION: The data from the TERRAIN trial support the use of enzalutamide rather than bicalutamide in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The aim of our analysis was to determine the relationship between low vitamin D levels and the risk of developing CWP in a population sample of middle age and elderly men. METHODS: Three thousand three hundred sixty nine men aged 40-79 were recruited from 8 European centres for a longitudinal study of male ageing, the European Male Ageing Study. At baseline participants underwent assessment of lifestyle, health factors, physical characteristics and gave a fasting blood sample. The occurrence of pain was assessed at baseline and follow up (a mean of 4.3Â years later) by shading painful sites on a body manikin. The presence of CWP was determined using the ACR criteria for fibromyalgia. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH) D) was assessed by radioimmunoassay. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between baseline vitamin D levels and the new occurrence of CWP. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred thirteen men, mean age 58.8Â years (SDâ=â10.6), had complete pain and vitamin data available and contributed to this analysis. 151 (6.5Â %) developed new CWP at follow up and 577 (24.9Â %) were pain free at both time points, the comparator group. After adjustment for age and centre, physical performance and number of comorbidities, compared to those in upper quintile of 25-(OH) D ( â¥36.3Â ng/mL), those in the lowest quintile (<15.6Â ng/mL) were more likely to develop CWP (Odds Ratio [OR]â=â1.93; 95Â % CIâ=â1.0-3.6). Further adjustment for BMI (ORâ=â1.67; 95Â % CIâ=â0.93-3.02) or depression (ORâ=â1.77; 95Â % CIâ=â0.98-3.21), however rendered the association non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D is linked with the new occurrence of CWP, although this may be explained by underlying adverse health factors, particularly obesity and depression.INTRODUCTION: Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is an uncommon condition. This following article describes a case of primary PCI presenting as acute abdomen due to perforation of a small bowel cyst. PRESENTATION OF CASE: This following article describes the case of an 88 year-old woman admitted at the hospital with peritonitis and consequently operated for a presumed bowel ischemia and perforation. However surgical exploration revealed perforated PCI. DISCUSSION: The pathophysiology of secondary PCI is poorly understood. Gas produced by Gas-forming bacteria may enter the mucosal barrier due and consequently this gas accumulates within the bowel wall. Also malnutrition can prevent the digestion of carbohydrates, which leads to increased bacterial fermentation, and production of large volumes of gas leading to distention and ischemia and subsequently the submucosal dissection of gas. Colonoscopy is helpful in excluding other colonic lesions and it shows the submucosal cysts that have a typical dual appearance: multiple white small cysts coupled to a sub-atrophic mucosa or larger cysts (up to 3cm) with a reddened overlying mucosa. CONCLUSION: The treatment unless complicated should be conservative even in the presence of pneumoperitoneum, after excluding complications.BACKGROUND: Breathlessness is common in patients with advanced cancer. Using a multidisciplinary approach for relieving this challenging symptom was believed to be just a theory. The "SOB Program" was implemented in our institution in March 2013. MEASURES: An audit of medical records before and after implementation of the "SOB Program" was performed to identify any changes in practice post implementation, specifically in the use of non-pharmacological interventions. INTERVENTION: The "SOB Program" is a multidisciplinary service in our department, using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for all patients with advanced cancer who have dyspnea. OUTCOMES: There was a marked increase in the use of non-pharmacological interventions after the "SOB Program" (26.86% pre- vs. 89.35% post-implementation). Patients joining the program also had satisfactory improvement in breathlessness. CONCLUSIONS/LESSONS LEARNED: A multidisciplinary approach for breathlessness control is both feasible and practical. Similar services can be promoted in other palliative care centers.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: During robot-assisted transaxillary thyroidectomy, the patient's arm is maintained in an overhead flexed position for a prolonged time, which poses a risk of postoperative brachial plexopathy. The aim of the study was to identify the causes of brachial plexopathy and to assess the benefit of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) in preventing positional brachial plexopathy in this setting. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: The computerized database of a tertiary medical center was searched for all consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted transaxillary thyroidectomy between 2012 and 2014. Clinical, operative, and outcome parameters were collected from the medical files. Findings were compared between patients operated with and without IONM. RESULTS: The cohort included 30 patients, 14 operated with IONM and 16 without. Three events of impending brachial plexopathy were detected in the monitored group. The monitored group had significantly better shoulder movement (P = .003), a lower rate of hypoesthesia (P = .011), less pain (P = .001) in the early postoperative period than the nonmonitored group and higher quality of life in the early postoperative period (P = .012). The monitored group was significantly younger than the nonmonitored one (P = .02) and had a significantly larger diameter of thyroid nodule than the nonmonitored group (P = .043). CONCLUSIONS: IONM during robot-assisted transaxillary thyroidectomy may improve short-term postoperative pain and shoulder movement and longer-term quality of life. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 2016.PMID: 26773980  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]BACKGROUND: The longitudinal association of depression and pain according to gender was investigated using a population-based sample from 13 European countries. METHODS: The study population was taken from waves 4-5 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. The sample consisted of 22,280 participants â¥50 years, who were interviewed at baseline, and after two years. Regression models for each gender were used to assess the variables associated with depression and pain incidence and persistence. RESULTS: Prevalences of depression, pain, and depression-pain co-occurrence, were higher in women than in men (depression: 34.5% vs. 20.3%; OR=2.1; 95% CI=1.9-2.2; pain: 60.2% vs. 53.5%; OR=1.3; 95% CI=1.2-1.4; co-occurrence 25.3% vs. 14.0%; OR=2.3; 95% CI=2.2-2.6). Treated baseline pain in women (OR=1.6; 95% CI=1.3-2.0), and treated/untreated pain in men (untreated OR=1.3; 95% CI=1.1-1.7; treated OR=2.0; 95% CI=1.5-2.7), were associated with incident depression. Untreated baseline depression was associated with incident pain (women OR=1.3; 95% CI=1.1-1.7; men OR=1.8; 95% CI=1.3-2.6), and with persistent pain only in women (OR=1.3; 95% CI=1.1-1.6). LIMITATIONS: We lack information on pain severity, and the consumption of analgesics was used as a proxy. We lack information on antidepressants and anxiolytics consumption separately. Participants were interviewed twice in two years, and pain/depression at both interviews were considered persistent although they may have relapsed and recurred. CONCLUSIONS: Treated baseline pain is a risk factor for incident depression in both genders; untreated baseline pain is a risk factor only in men. Treating depression at baseline may protect from developing pain in both genders, and in women, it may also protect from pain persistence.A 53-year-old man presented with pain in the right hip. Radiological examination showed idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) combined with a cam lesion. Findings on physical examination were consistent for femoroacetabular impingement. At surgery, we performed isolated arthroscopic correction for the cam lesion but did not use other treatment options such as hip arthroplasty or osteotomies for the ONFH. At the latest follow-up evaluation 3 years after surgery, findings indicted a satisfactory outcome, with a Harris hip score of 93.2 (compared with 76.4 before surgery), no joint-space narrowing, and no collapse of the femoral head. It is important to accurately diagnose the status of idiopathic ONFH and to consider another possible pathogenesis when a patient with idiopathic ONFH has hip pain even without femoral-head collapse.Growing evidence shows interrelations of psychological factors, neurological and immunological processes. Therefore, constructs like a balance of activities, the so called "occupational balance", could also have biological correlates. The aim of this study was to investigate potential associations between occupational balance, functioning, cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients suffering from a chronic inflammatory disease like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy people. Moreover, we wanted to explore potential differences in gender and employment status. A descriptive study in patients with RA and healthy people was conducted using the Occupational Balance-Questionnaire (OB-Quest) and the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Serum levels of cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and 8 (IL-8), interferon alpha (INFÎ±), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±), rheumatoid factor (RF) and of CRP were measured. Descriptive statistics, as well as Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearmen's rank correlation coefficients (rs) were calculated. One-hundred-thirty-two patients with RA and 76 healthy people participated. Occupational balance was associated with functioning, cytokines and CRP. The strongest associations were identified in the unemployed healthy-people sample with cytokines and CRP being within the normal range. For example, the OB-Quest item challenging activities was associated with IL-8 (rs=-0.63, p=0.04) and the SF-36 sub-scale bodily pain was associated with IFNÎ± (rs=-0.69, p=0.02). The items rest and sleep (rs=-0.71, p=0.01) and variety of different activities (rs=-0.74, p<0.01) correlated with the SF-36 sub-scale social functioning. Employed and unemployed people differed in their age and CRP levels. Additionally, gender differences were found in two OB-Quest items in that fewer women were able to adapt their activities to changing living conditions and fewer men were overstressed. In conclusion, we found preliminary biological evidence for the link between occupation and health in that the concepts encompassed in the construct of occupational balance were associated with functioning, cytokines and CRP.PURPOSE: The present review article aims to provide an overview of the available radionuclides for palliative treatment of bone metastases beyond (89)Sr and (153)Sm. In addition, it aims to review and summarize the clinical outcomes associated with the palliative treatment of bone metastases using different radiopharmaceuticals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Science Direct and PubMed databases (1990 - 2015). The following search terms were combined in order to obtain relevant results: "bone", "metastases", "palliative", "care", "therapy", "treatment", "radiotherapy", "review", "radiopharmaceutical", "phosphorus-32", "strontium-89", "yttrium-90", "tin-117m", "samarium-153", "holmium-166", "thulium-170", "lutetium-177", "rhenium-186", "rhenium-188" and "radium-223". Studies were included if they provided information regarding the clinical outcomes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A comparative analysis of the measured therapeutic response of different radiopharmaceuticals, based on previously published data, suggests that there is a lack of substantial differences in palliative efficacy among radiopharmaceuticals. However, when the comparative analysis adds factors such as patient's life expectancy, radionuclides' physical characteristics (e.g. tissue penetration range and half-life) and health economics to guide the rational selection of a radiopharmaceutical for palliative treatment of bone metastases, (177)Lu and (188)Re-labeled radiopharmaceuticals appear to be the most suitable radiopharmaceuticals for treatment of small and medium/large size bone lesions, respectively.BACKGROUND: This prospective study describes the procedure-related anxiety, treatment-related anxiety, pain, and nausea experienced by children with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during the first year of treatment. METHODS: This study was undertaken at 31 Children's Oncology Group (COG) sites. Eligible children who were 2 to 9.99 years old were enrolled in a COG trial for patients with newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL from 2005 to 2009. Parents completed a demographic survey at the baseline and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.0 Cancer Module (proxy version) and the General Functioning Scale of the Family Assessment Device 1, 6, and 12 months after the diagnosis. The association between patient-related (age, sex, ethnicity, and treatment), parent-related (marital status and education), and family-related factors (functioning, income, and size) and symptom scores was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean scores for procedure-related anxiety, treatment-related anxiety, and pain improved during the first year of treatment (P < .0389). The mean nausea score was poorer 6 months after the diagnosis in comparison with the other assessments (P = .0085). A younger age at diagnosis was associated with significantly worse procedure-related anxiety (P = .004). An older age (P = .0002) and assignment to the intensified consolidation study arm (P = .02) were associated with significantly worse nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL experienced decreasing treatment-related anxiety, procedure-related anxiety, and pain during the first year of treatment. In comparison with scores at 1 and 12 months, nausea was worse 6 months after the diagnosis. Minimization of procedure-related anxiety in younger children and improved nausea control in older children and those receiving more intensified treatment should be prioritized. Cancer 2016.

Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed some possible mechanism of physiological effects for healthy pregnancies and showed a metabolic trajectory during pregnancy process. The levels of 24 metabolites were found to change significantly throughout pregnancy in maternal plasma. These metabolite changes involved in varied kinds of metabolic pathways including synthesis of biological substances, microbial metabolism in diverse environments, protein digestion and absorption, carbohydrate metabolism, digestion and absorption, mineral absorption, and ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters). The substantial cores of all the metabolic pathways are promoting fetal growth and development and regulating maternal physiological state. This work showed relevant metabolic pathways perturbation in the maternal plasma due to normal pregnancy and provided the physical basis of time-dependent metabolic trajectory against which disease-related maternal physiological responses may be better understood in future studies.BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have found appraisals of pain as a source of potential threat or tissue damage influence pain perception and coping. Conversely, causal effects of challenge appraisals reflecting potential future benefits of bearing pain have received little attention. This experiment was designed to elucidate effects of appraising laboratory pain as a source of potential threat and challenge on pain perception and coping. METHODS: Before engaging in a cold pressor test (CPT), young adult women (NÂ =Â 112) and men (NÂ =Â 49) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a higher threat group in which participants read an orienting passage describing symptoms and consequences of frostbite (pain as a signal for nociception), a lower threat group in which participants read about CPT safety (pain independent of nociception) or a challenge appraisal group in which participants read a passage describing how persistence in the face of discomfort predicts future life success and satisfaction. RESULTS: The higher threat group had lower pain tolerance and catastrophized more during the task than lower threat and challenge appraisal groups. Conversely, the challenge appraisal group reported using more cognitive strategies (ignoring, diverting attention, coping self-statements) in managing pain than either threat group. Structural equationÂ modelling indicated paths of subjective threat and challenge appraisals with pain tolerance were fully mediated by individual differences in reported cognitive coping and/or pain catastrophizing. CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore causal effects of pain appraisals on coping responses and pain perception. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: Effects of challenge appraisals of pain as a source of potential future growth or development have not been considered in experimental pain research. Causal effects of primary appraisals of laboratory pain as a source of potential threat and challenge were elucidated in relation to pain perception and coping.Parents of children with chromosome 15q duplication syndrome (Dup15q) have anecdotally reported high pain threshold as a feature of the disorder. The purpose of this study was to document parental-reported estimates of the frequency of high pain tolerance and the stimuli that fail to evoke a normal pain response. We sent an online survey to 840 families with children with Dup15q to explore the frequency and clinical manifestations of high pain threshold. There were 216 respondents (25.7%). A high pain threshold was reported in 87% of children at some time. There was a trend (p=0.06) for high pain threshold to be more commonly observed among children with the isodicentric (85.6%) and other genetic variants (95%) than interstitial (69.6%) duplications. There was no association between reports of high pain threshold and reports of an intellectual disability (91% of cases), autism spectrum disorder (83% of cases), or self-injurious behavior (40% of cases). Reports included many dramatic cases such as severe burns, broken bones, and electrical traumas, which were associated with little or no evidence of a painful stimulus. A high pain threshold is reported in other disorders associated with intellectual disability and autism; the underlying mechanism in Dup15q and other disorders remains undefined.PURPOSE: To draw attention to epileptic pain which is a rare seizure symptom mostly causing wrong diagnosis and delayed treatment. We present nine patients in whom pain was a prominent initial or early ictal symptom. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 4736 patients, and found nine patients who had pain as an aura or an early prominent symptom of their seizures. Seizure semiology, EEG, and cranial imaging features were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Age at seizure onset ranged from 6months to 50years, and the mean age during the study was 37.7Â±11.9years. Pain was predominantly peripherally localized in four patients, whereas cephalic pain was detected in three patients, and abdominal pain was detected in two patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed epileptic abnormalities on the temporoparietal and frontotemporal regions in three patients each. Photosensitive generalized epileptic discharges were detected in one and diffuse background slowing in the remaining two other patients. Electroencephalography abnormalities were lateralized to the contralateral site of the pain in four patients with strictly localized pain. Three patients revealed no abnormality on the cranial MR imaging, whereas others showed different types of abnormality such as heterotopias (n:1), mesial temporal lobe atrophy (n:1), white and gray matter sequela lesions (n:1), diffuse white matter lesion (n:1), chronic encephalomalacia and gliosis (n:1), and perivascular space dilatation (n:1). CONCLUSION: Epileptic pain is a neglected, but important, semiologic symptom with localization and lateralization value in the patients with somatosensorial seizures of parietal as well as temporal lobe origin. It occurs mainly as peripherally localized, cephalic, or abdominal pain and is usually associated with a symptomatic etiology. Awareness of epileptic pain is important to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.PMID: 26773635  [PubMed - in process]Nerve impairment is a key clinical aspect of leprosy and may present the distribution of mononeuropathy or multiple nerve trunks, small cutaneous nerve fibers, and free nerve endings. The clinical range of leprosy is determined by individual cell-mediated immune response to infection that also may play a role in different types of pain syndromes in leprosy. Previous studies reported a high prevalence of neuropathic pain in leprosy. In an Ethiopian study with 48 patients, pure nociceptive pain was experienced by 43% of patients and pure neuropathic pain (NeP) by 11% of patients. In an Indian study, 21.8% of leprosy patients had pain with neuropathic characteristics. These rates underlie the need to develop tools for the early diagnosis and detection of infection and its complications, such as nerve damage and pain. In a larger sample with leprosy-associated NeP (n = 90), we have applied the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions (DN4) and found sensitivity = 97.1% and specificity = 57.9%. The high sensitivity of this tool in leprosy patients suggests that it could be a valuable tool to screen for neuropathic pain in this population and could be used as part of health care programs aimed at detecting, treating, and rehabilitating leprosy in endemic areas.Leprosy neuropathy is dependent on the patient's immune response and expresses itself as a focal or multifocal neuropathy with asymmetric involvement. Leprosy neuropathy evolves chronically but recurrently develops periods of exacerbation during type 1 or type 2 reactions, leading to acute neuropathy. Nerve enlargement leading to entrapment syndromes is also a common manifestation. Pain may be either of inflammatory or neuropathic origin. A thorough and detailed evaluation is mandatory for adequate patient follow-up, including nerve palpation, pain assessment, graded sensory mapping, muscle power testing, and autonomic evaluation. Nerve conduction studies are a sensitive tool for nerve dysfunction, including new lesions during reaction periods or development of entrapment syndromes. Nerve ultrasonography is also a very promising method for nerve evaluation in leprosy. The authors propose a composite nerve clinical score for nerve function assessment that can be useful for longitudinal evaluation.BACKGROUND: Widespread musculoskeletal pain (WSP) and obesity frequently co-occur and may have shared risk factors. We aimed to investigate whether four dichotomized risk factors individually or jointly increase the risk for the onset of WSP and onset of obesity. METHODS: Persons aged 34-76Â years in 2004 living in Ullensaker municipality, Norway, responded to questionnaires in 2004 and 2010 (nÂ =Â 1553). Using causal interaction analyses, we examined whether baseline obesity and WSP, poor sleep quality, mental distress and poor physical fitness jointly increased the risk of new onset WSP (â¥3 pain sites leading to disability the last year) and new onset obesity (self-reported BMI â¥30Â kg/m(2) ) in persons without WSP (nÂ =Â 1270) or without obesity (nÂ =Â 1300) at baseline respectively. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 51 (12.1) years and 56% were female. The incidence of WSP and obesity were 9.1% and 5.4%. Mental distress and poor sleep quality individually and jointly with poor physical fitness increased WSP onset risk (relative excess risk due to interaction [RERI]Â =Â 1.90, 95% CI, 0.39-3.42 and RERIÂ =Â 1.43, 95% CI, 0.10-2.76). Poor physical fitness individually increased the risk for new onset obesity, and baseline WSP and poor sleep quality jointly (RERIÂ =Â 1.87, 95% CI, 0.49-3.24). The presence of more risk factors was dose-dependently associated with onset WSP and to a lesser extent with onset obesity. CONCLUSION: The onset of WSP and the onset of obesity were results of joint effects of exposures. Poor physical fitness was a key covariate in increasing the risk for both conditions. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: In a general population, the new onset of widespread pain and new onset of obesity were results of joint effects of risk factors and particularly poor physical fitness. The study may aid in the identification of patients at risk of future disability.BACKGROUND: Although there are a limited number of studies showing effects of neck stretching exercises following a thyroidectomy in reducing neck discomfort symptoms, no study has specifically dealt with and examined the effect of neck stretching exercises on neck pain and disability. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of neck stretching exercises, following a total thyroidectomy, on reducing neck pain and disability. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. The participants were randomly assigned either to the stretching exercise group (n = 40) or to the control group (n = 40). The stretching exercise group learned the neck stretching exercises immediately after total thyroidectomy. The effects of the stretching exercises on the participants' neck pain and disability, neck sensitivity, pain with neck movements as well as on wound healing, were evaluated at the end of the first week and at 1 month following surgery. RESULTS: When comparing neck pain and disability scale (NPDS) scores, neck sensitivity and pain with neck movement before thyroidectomy, after 1 week and after 1-month time-points, it was found that patients experienced significantly less pain and disability in the stretching exercise group than the control group (p < .001). At the end of the first week, the NPDS scores (mean [SD] = 8.82 [12.23] vs. 30.28 [12.09]), neck sensitivity scores (median [IR] = 0 [.75] vs. 2.00 [4.0]) and pain levels with neck movements (median [IR] = 0 [2.0] vs. 3.5 [5.75]) of the stretching exercise group were significantly lower than those of the control group. However, there was no significant difference between the groups with regard to the scores at the 1-month evaluation (p > .05). LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Neck stretching exercises done immediately after a total thyroidectomy reduce short-term neck pain and disability symptoms.Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hand is a common disease resulting in pain and impaired function. The pathogenesis of hand OA (HOA) is elusive and models to study it have not been described. Chondrocyte culture has been essential to understand cartilage degeneration, which is a hallmark of OA. We investigated the feasibility of human chondrocyte culture derived from proximal interphalangeal (PIP) finger joints. Hyaline cartilage of the PIP and knee joints was obtained from human cadavers. Chondrocytes harvested up to 236 hours after death of the donors were viable and expressed chondrocyte-specific genes. Gene expression comparing chondrocytes from PIP and knee joints using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays resulted in a unique PIP-specific gene expression pattern. Genes involved in developmental processes including the WNT pathway were differentially expressed between the joints. These findings suggest that our knowledge on chondrocyte biology derived mainly from knee and hip joints may not apply to chondrocytes of the PIP joints and some of the distinctive features of HOA may be caused by the specific properties of PIP chondrocytes. Chondrocyte culture of PIP cartilage is a novel tool to study cartilage degeneration in HOA. This article is protected by copyright.

The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in fibromyalgia has allowed for the detection of neural abnormalities, with alterations in brain activation elicited by experimental pain and alterations in resting state connectivity related to clinical pain. METHODS: In this study, we sought to monitor state changes in resting brain connectivity following experimental pressure pain in fibromyalgia patients and healthy controls. Twelve fibromyalgia patients and 15 healthy controls were studied by applying discrete pressure stimuli to the thumbnail bed during MRI. Resting-state functional MRI scanning was performed before and immediately following experimental pressure pain. We investigated changes in functional connectivity to the thalamus and the insular cortex. RESULTS: Acute pressure pain increased insula connectivity to the anterior cingulate and the hippocampus. Additionally, we observed increased thalamic connectivity to the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, a known part of the default mode network, in patients but not in controls. This connectivity was correlated with changes in clinical pain. CONCLUSIONS: These data reporting changes in resting-state brain activity following a noxious stimulus suggest that the acute painful stimuli may contribute to the alteration of the neural signature of chronic pain. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY/ADD?: In this study acute pain application shows an echo in functional connectivity and clinical pain changes in chronic pain.BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, and may occur following stressful events or infectious gastroenteritis such as giardiasis. Recent findings revealed a link between cholecystokinin (CCK), neurotrophin synthesis, and intestinal hyperalgesia. The aim was to investigate the role of CCK in visceral hypersensitivity using mouse models challenged with a bout of infection with Giardia lamblia or psychological stress, either alone or in combination. METHODS: Abdominal pain was evaluated by visceromoter response to colorectal distension. Nerve fibers in intestinal tissues were stained using immunohistochemistry (PGP9.5). Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells incubated with bacterial-free mouse gut supernatant or recombinant CCK-8S were assessed for neurite outgrowth and nerve growth factor (NGF) production. RESULTS: Intestinal hypersensitivity was induced by either stress or Giardia infection, and a trend of increased pain was seen following dual stimuli. Increased CCK levels and PGP9.5 immunoreactivity were found in colonic mucosa of mice following stress and/or infection. Inhibitors to the CCK-A receptor (L-364718) or CCK-B receptor (L-365260) blocked visceral hypersensitivity caused by stress, but not when induced by giardiasis. Nerve fiber elongation and NGF synthesis were observed in SH-SY5Y cells after incubation with colonic supernatants from mice given the dual stimuli, or after treatment with CCK-8S. Increased nerve fiber length by colonic supernatant and CCK-8S was attenuated by L-365260 or neutralizing anti-NGF. CONCLUSIONS: This new model successfully recapitulates intestinal hypernociception induced by stress or Giardia. Colonic CCK contributes to visceral hypersensitivity caused by stress, but not by Giardia, partly via NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth.PMID: 26773195  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]OBJECTIVE: To study single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in angiogenesis (VEGF, PLGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, HIF-1Î±) and plasma levels of the corresponding proteins (VEGF, PLGF, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2) in women with and without endometriosis. DESIGN: Allele frequencies of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway SNPs and plasma levels of the corresponding proteinsÂ were investigated in patients with endometriosis and in controls. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Samples of DNA from 1,931 Caucasian patients were included (1,109 patients with endometriosis and 822 controls). An additional study group included 973 DNA samples from volunteers, self-reported to be healthy without laparoscopic evaluation. INTERVENTION(S): Women who underwent a laparoscopy for subfertility and/or pain and healthy volunteers without laparoscopic evaluation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Functional SNPs of the VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, HIF-1Î± genes and Hap Map tagging SNPs of theÂ PLGF gene were genotyped by using iPLEX technology on a Sequenom MassArray and TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay.Â The VEGF levels were determined in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma samples by using Bio-Plex Protein Array System. PLGF, sVEGFR1, and sVEGFR2 levels were measured in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma samples by using ELISA Quantikine kits. RESULT(S): A significant association was found between the rs2268613 polymorphism in the PLGF gene and PLGF plasma levels. InÂ all study subjects, women with the AA variant of the rs2268613 PLGF gene had significantly lower PLGF plasma levels (medianÂ [interquartile range] 9.36 [8.19-10.43] pg/mL) than those with the AG variant (12.1 [11.81-20.84] pg/mL; P(a)=.0085, P(b)=.04), both before and after multiple testing. Plasma levels of VEGF were elevated in endometriosis patients (especially in minimal-mild endometriosis during the menstrual cycle phase) compared with laparoscopic controls but had a moderate diagnosticÂ performance (area under the curve, 0.73) in this discovery dataset. At a cut-off plasma level of VEGF >3.88 pg/mL, minimal-mild stages of endometriosis were diagnosed with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 80% during the menstrual phase of cycle. The associations between the presence of endometriosis and SNPs in PLGF (rs2268614), HIF-1Î± (rs11549465), and VEGFR1 (rs9582036) genes lost statistical significance after multiple testing. CONCLUSION(S): Genetic variants in the PLGF rs2268613 gene may influence plasma levels of the corresponding protein. Plasma levels of VEGF were elevated in endometriosis patients compared with controls. The associations between the presence of endometriosis and SNPs in PLGF (rs2268614), HIF-1Î± (rs11549465), and VEGFR1 (rs9582036) genes lost statistical significance after multiple testing.Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block technique seems to offer one of the most efficient methods for a local pain control. Our aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of TAP block for post-operative pain control under laparoscopic vision in elderly patients during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patients aged more than 65 years old, who had cholecystectomy due to symptomatic cholelithiasis, were retrospectively evaluated. The patients that were operated under general anesthesia + laparoscopic TAP block and those who were operated only under only general anesthesia were compared according to their' age and gender, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and length of stay in the hospital. Median (Â±interquartile range) values of post-operative 24th-hour-VAS for pain was found consecutively 2 (Â±1-3) in TAP block + group and 3 (Â±2-5) in TAP block - group. The median post-operative 24th-hour-VAS value in overall patients was three. Patients' VAS values were higher in the TAP block - group with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.001). Furthermore, no statistically significant difference was found for other parameters in two groups. The laparoscopic-guided TAP block can easily be performed and has potential for lower visceral injury risk and shorter operational time. Efficacy, safety and other advantages (analgesic requirements, etc.) make it an ideal abdominal field block in elderly patients.The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a cross-talk between opioid receptors (OPRs) and adenosine receptors (ADRs) in remifentanil preconditioning (R-Pre) and, if so, to investigate the types of ADRs involved in the cross-talk. Isolated rat hearts received 30 min of regional ischemia followed by 2 hr of reperfusion. OPR and ADR antagonists were perfused from 10 min before R-Pre until the end of R-Pre. The heart rate, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP),velocity of contraction (+dP/dtmax), and coronary flow (CF) were recorded. The area at risk and area of necrosis were measured. After reperfusion, the LVDP, +dP/dtmax,and CF showed a significant increase in the R-Pre group compared with the control group (no intervention before or after regional ischemia). These increases in the R-Pre group were blocked by naloxone, a nonspecific ADR antagonist, an A1 ADR antagonist, and an A2B ADR antagonist. The infarct size was reduced significantly in the R-Pre group compared with the control group. The infarct-reducing effect in the R-Pre group was blocked by naloxone, the nonspecific ADR antagonist, the A1 ADR antagonist, and the A2B ADR antagonist. The results of this study demonstrate that there is cross-talk between ADRs and OPRs in R-Pre and that A1 ADR and A2B ADR appear to be involved in the cross-talk.INTRODUCTION: Anaesthesia Information Management Systems (AIMS) generate large amounts of data which might be useful for quality assurance programs. This study was designed to highlight the multiple contributions of our AIMS system in extracting quality indicators over a period of 10 years. METHODS: The study was conducted from 2002 to 2011. Two methods were used to extract anaesthesia indicators: the manual extraction of individual files for monitoring neuromuscular relaxation and structured query language (SQL) extraction for other indicators which were postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), pain, sedation scores, pain related medications, scores and postoperative hypothermia. For each indicator, a program of information/meetings and adaptation/suggestions for operating room and PACU personnel was initiated to improve quality assurance, while data were extracted each year. RESULTS: The study included 77,573 patients. The mean overall completeness of data for the initial years ranged from 55 to 85% and was indicator dependent, which then improved to 95% completeness for the last 5 years. The incidence of neuromuscular monitoring was initially 67% and then increased to 95% (p < 0.05). The rate of pharmacological reversal remained around 53% throughout the study. Regarding SQL data, an improvement of severe postoperative pain and PONV scores was observed throughout the study, while mild postoperative hypothermia remained a challenge, despite efforts for improvement. DISCUSSION: The AIMS system permitted the follow-up of certain indicators through manual sampling and many more via SQL extraction in a sustained and non-time-consuming way across years. However, it requires competent and especially dedicated resources to handle the data base.OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of different analytical methods, baseline covariates, followup periods, and anchor questions when establishing a minimal important difference (MID) for individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Second, to propose MID for improving and worsening on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 272 patients with knee OA undergoing a multidisciplinary nonsurgical management strategy. The magnitude and rate of change as well as the influence of baseline covariates were examined for 5 KOOS subscales over 52 weeks. The MID for improving and worsening were investigated using 4 anchor-based methods. RESULTS: Waitlisted for joint replacement and exhibiting unilateral/bilateral symptoms influenced change in KOOS over time. Generally, low correlations between anchors and KOOS change scores limited calculations of MID; thus, they were only proposed for the pain, activities of daily living, and quality of life subscales. The method used to calculate the MID influenced the cutpoint; however, the type of anchor question only influenced the MID when analyzed with a particular mean change method. Depending on patient and clinical characteristics, the subscale, and the analytical approach used, the MID for KOOS improvement ranged from an absolute change of -1.5 to 20.6 points and worsening ranged from -19.17 to 8.5 points. CONCLUSION: MID vary with patient and clinical characteristics, KOOS subscale, and analytical approach. Provided the anchor question is relevant to the patient-reported outcome and baseline status is considered, the anchor does not appear to influence the MID for improvement or worsening when using some anchor-based methods.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of brodalumab on psoriasis signs and symptoms assessed by the Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: This prespecified analysis of a phase II study (NCT01516957) evaluated patients with active PsA and psoriasis-affected body surface area â¥ 3%, randomized to brodalumab (140 or 280 mg) or placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 12 weeks with loading dose at Week 1. At Week 12, patients entering an open-label extension received brodalumab 280 mg Q2W. The PSI measures 8 psoriasis signs and symptoms: itch, redness, scaling, burning, stinging, cracking, flaking, and pain. PSI response is defined as total PSI â¤ 8 (range 0-32), each item â¤ 1 (range 0-4). PSI scores were assessed at weeks 12 and 24. RESULTS: There were 107 eligible patients. At Week 12, mean improvement in PSI scores was 7.8, 11.2, and 1.5 in brodalumab 140 mg, 280 mg, and placebo groups, respectively; by Week 24, improvement was 10.2, 12.4, and 11.7. At Week 12, 75.0%, 81.8%, and 16.7% of patients receiving brodalumab 140 mg, 280 mg, and placebo, respectively, achieved PSI response; improvement was sustained through Week 24, when 83.9% of prior placebo recipients achieved response. At Week 12, 25.0%, 36.4%, and 2.8% of patients receiving brodalumab 140 mg, 280 mg, and placebo, respectively, achieved PSI 0. Percentages improved through Week 24: 40.0% brodalumab 140 mg, 42.9% brodalumab 280 mg, and 48.4% placebo. CONCLUSION: Significantly more brodalumab-treated patients with PsA achieved patient-reported improvements in psoriasis signs and symptoms than did those receiving placebo. Improvements were comparable between brodalumab groups.OBJECTIVE: Arthritis and its associated joint pain act as significant barriers for adults attempting to perform land-based physical activity. Swimming can be an ideal form of exercise for patients with arthritis. Yet there is no information on the efficacy of regular swimming exercise involving patients with arthritis. The effect of a swimming exercise intervention on joint pain, stiffness, and physical function was evaluated in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Using a randomized study design, 48 sedentary middle-aged and older adults with OA underwent 3 months of either swimming or cycling exercise training. Supervised exercise training was performed for 45 min/day, 3 days/week at 60-70% heart rate reserve for 12 weeks. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index was used to measure joint pain, stiffness, and physical limitation. RESULTS: After the exercise interventions, there were significant reductions in joint pain, stiffness, and physical limitation accompanied by increases in quality of life in both groups (all p < 0.05). Functional capacity as assessed by maximal handgrip strength, isokinetic knee extension and flexion power (15-30% increases), and the distance covered in the 6-min walk test increased (all p < 0.05) in both exercise groups. No differences were observed in the magnitude of improvements between swimming and cycling training. CONCLUSION: Regular swimming exercise reduced joint pain and stiffness associated with OA and improved muscle strength and functional capacity in middle-aged and older adults with OA. Additionally, the benefits of swimming exercise were similar to the more frequently prescribed land-based cycling training. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT01836380.BACKGROUND: Obstructed Hemivagina and Ipsilateral Renal Anomaly (OHVIRA) syndrome is a Mullerian duct anomaly characterized by uterine didelphys, obstructed hemivagina, and ipsilateral renal anomalies. CASE: A 12 year old female with a history of right renal agenesis presented to the ED with abdominal pain, dysuria, and urinary retention. Imaging identified a uterine didelphys with a large obstructed right-hemivagina compressing the left ureter causing hydronephrosis. She underwent vaginal septum resection for curative treatment. CONCLUSION: In female patients presenting with abdominal pain and a history of renal abnormalities, OHVIRA syndrome must be considered on the differential. This consideration is important in preventing complications such as hydronephrosis seen in this patient.Carpal tunnel release for compression of the median nerve at the wrist is one of the most common and successful procedures in hand surgery. Complications, though rare, are potentially devastating and may include intraoperative technical errors, postoperative infection and pain, and persistent or recurrent symptoms. Patients with continued complaints after carpal tunnel release should be carefully evaluated with detailed history and physical examination in addition to electrodiagnostic testing. For those with persistent or recurrent symptoms, a course of nonoperative management including splinting, injections, occupational therapy, and desensitization should be considered prior to revision surgery.Two complications after total hip arthroplasty (THA) are hip instability and limb length discrepancy; instability is a common indication for revision THA. The goal of a successful THA is to maximize impingement-free range of motion, recreate appropriate offset, and equalize limb length discrepancies to produce a pain-free and dynamically stable THA. In this article, the patient risk factors for dislocation and limb length discrepancy, key elements of the preoperative template, the anatomic landmarks for accurate component placement, the leg positions for soft tissue stability testing, and the management of postoperative instability are reviewed.There are many causes of residual pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Evaluation and management begins with a comprehensive history and physical examination, followed by radiographic evaluation of the replaced and adjacent joints, as well as previous films of the replaced joint. Further workup includes laboratory analysis, along with a synovial fluid aspirate to evaluate the white blood cell count with differential as well as culture. Advanced imaging modalities may be beneficial when the diagnosis remains unclear. Revision surgery is not advisable without a clear diagnosis, as it may be associated with poor results.BACKGROUND: The determination of cardiac troponin is essential for diagnosing myocardial infarction. A troponin I assay has recently been developed that provides the highest analytical sensitivity to date. METHODS: The analysis included 1560 patients with chest pain, of whom 1098 were diagnosed with non-coronary chest pain, 189 with unstable angina pectoris and 273 with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The troponin I concentration was determined on admission (0 hours) and 3 hours later. The diagnostic algorithm incorporated troponin I elevation above the gender-specific 99th percentile as well as predefined relative or absolute 3-hour changes in the troponin I concentration (delta). RESULTS: The diagnostic criterion of troponin I above the 99th percentile resulted in a negative predictive value of 98.0% and 98.2% in men and women, respectively. For rule-in of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, the use of absolute deltas yielded higher positive predictive values and sensitivities compared to relative deltas. With detection rates of about 85% and 82% in men and women, respectively, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was diagnosed with a positive predictive value close to 84% in men and 80% in women. CONCLUSIONS: The investigational troponin I assay provides an excellent non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction rule out. With gender-specific differences, the application of absolute changes in troponin concentration was superior to relative changes to rule in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: The orthopaedic program at a large academic teaching hospital introduced a quality initiative for the primary hip and knee arthroplasty population with the goal to reduce the overall length of stay (LOS) to less than 3 days while ensuring an efficient and exceptional patient experience. This article focuses on the process used to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the changes made to achieve a reduction in length of stay. METHOD: The initiative involved current and future process mapping, patient and staff education, a comprehensive mobility strategy, pain management pathways and an evaluation of the patient and provider experience. The goal to reduce LOS for both primary hip and knee arthroplasty surgery was achieved. CONCLUSION: The patients were satisfied with their overall experience including their LOS and preparedness for discharge home.BACKGROUND: Plantar fasciopathy is a common cause of foot pain, accounting for 11 to 15Â % of all foot symptoms requiring professional care in adults. Although many patients have complete resolution of symptoms within 12Â months, many patients wish to reduce this period as much as possible. Orthotic devices are a frequently applied option of treatment in daily practice, despite a lack of evidence on the effectiveness. Therefore, the objective is to study the (cost)-effectiveness of custom made insoles by a podiatrist, compared to placebo insoles and usual care in patients with plantar fasciopathy in general practice and sports medicine clinics. METHOD/DESIGN: This study is a multi-center three-armed participant and assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial with 6-months follow-up. Patients with plantar fasciopathy, with a minimum duration of complaints of 2Â weeks and aged between 18 and 65, who visit their general practitioner or sport physician are eligible for inclusion. A total of 185 patients will be randomized into three parallel groups. One group will receive usual care by the general practitioner or sports physician alone, one group will be referred to a podiatrist and will receive a custom made insole, and one group will be referred to a podiatrist and will receive a placebo insole. The primary outcome will be the change from baseline to 12Â weeks follow-up in pain severity at rest and during activity on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS). Secondary outcomes include foot function (according to the Foot Function Index) at 6, 12 and 26Â weeks, recovery (7-point Likert) at 6, 12 and 26Â weeks, pain at rest and during activity (NRS) at 6 and 26Â weeks and cost-effectiveness of the intervention at 26-weeks. Measurements will take place at baseline and at, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 26Â weeks of follow-up. DISCUSSION: The treatment of plantar fasciopathy is a challenge for health care professionals. Orthotic devices are frequently applied, despite a lack of evidence of the effectiveness on patient reported outcome. The results of this randomized controlled trial will improve the evidence base for treating this troublesome condition in daily practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Registration: NTR5346 . Date of registration: August 5(th) 2015.PURPOSE: To test the feasibility and safety of performing laparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) on renal cancer patients as outpatient surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, descriptive study was conducted between April 2014 and February 2015, with postoperative follow-up at thirty days. In total, 140 patients were diagnosed with renal cancer during this period. 50 patients met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. Reasons for exclusion included planned partial nephrectomy (n=35), lived alone without adequate home support (n=17), advanced age or significant co-morbid conditions (n=33) and declined to participate (n=5). OUTCOME MEASURES AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Pain, nausea, fatigue, operations time, bleeding, time to stay in the postoperative care unit and hospital stay were assessed. Continuous variables were compared using a paired t-test, and categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients undergoing planned outpatient surgery was 59.8 years [35 (70%) males; 15 (30%) females]. Forty-six patients (92%) were discharged within the first 6 hours after surgery. Four patients (8%) could not be discharged, 2 patients because of wrong medication, one patient due to fatigue and another one due to intestinal injury. None of the 46 early-discharge patients were readmitted to the hospital, 2 patients had haft wound infection with a good results of oral antibiotic treatment without re-admission. CONCLUSION: LN may be performed as outpatient surgery in carefully selected patients meeting inclusion criteria (>40% of candidates for LN). Our study demonstrates that outpatient nephrectomy may be done safely and does not require readmission.BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain assessment remains a significant problem in clinical care despite patients wanting to describe their pain and be treated as unique individuals. Deeper knowledge about variations in patients' experiences and actions could help healthcare professionals to improve pain management and could increase patients' participation in pain assessments. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was, through an examination of critical incidents, to describe patients' experiences and actions when needing to describe pain after surgery. METHODS: An explorative design involving the critical incident technique was used. Patients from one university and three county hospitals in both urban and rural areas were included. To ensure variation of patients a strategic sampling was made according to age, gender, education and surgery. A total of 25 patients who had undergone orthopaedic or general surgery was asked to participate in an interview, of whom three declined. FINDINGS: Pain experiences were described according to two main areas: "Patients' resources when in need of pain assessment" and "Ward resources for performing pain assessments". Patients were affected by their expectations and tolerance for pain. Ability to describe pain could be limited by a fear of coming into conflict with healthcare professionals or being perceived as whining. Furthermore, attitudes from healthcare professionals and their lack of adherence to procedures affected patients' ability to describe pain. Two main areas regarding actions emerged: "Patients used active strategies when needing to describe pain" and "Patients used passive strategies when needing to describe pain". Patients informed healthcare professionals about their pain and asked questions in order to make decisions about their pain situation. Selfcare was performed by distraction and avoiding pain or treating pain by themselves, while others were passive and endured pain or refrained from contact with healthcare professionals due to healthcare professionals' large work load.OBJECTIVE: To assess the endourologic outcomes of patients diagnosed with a horseshoe kidney and symptomatic urolithiasis. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients diagnosed with a horseshoe kidney who underwent endoscopic management from 2002-present. RESULTS: We identified 45 patients with 64 stone bearing moieties that underwent 56 procedures, of which 31 (69%) were male. Mean age was 49.4 years (23-78) and mean stone size was 1.6cm (0.2-5.7). Of the 64 moieties, 37 (58%) underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), 25 (39%) ureteroscopy and 2 (3%) extracorporal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). More than one access was utilized in 2 (5.7%) moieties undergoing PCNL. Additional procedures were required in 10 (28.5%) PCNL patients, of which 7 were ureteroscopy, 2 secondary PCNL, and 1 sandwich therapy with SWL and PCNL. Stone free rate by moiety was 81.1% for PCNL, 84% for URS, and 50% for SWL. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 patients in the PCNL group, including readmission for pain and complicated UTI. With a mean follow up of 20.5 months (range 0-118 months), stone recurrence was noted in 7 (16%) patients with a total of 11 events. Calcium oxalate was the most common stone type and 20/24 (83%) of patients with metabolic evaluations were found to have at least one abnormality. CONCLUSION: After careful consideration of the anatomy, individuals with horseshoe kidney and symptomatic urolithiasis can be managed safely by a variety of endoscopic approaches with excellent outcomes; however, secondary procedures and recurrence is common.PMID: 26772619  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a pain syndrome, the mechanisms and predictors of which are still unclear. We have earlier validated a set of FM-symptom questions for detecting possible FM in an epidemiological survey and thereby identified a cluster with "possible FM". This study explores prospectively predictors for membership of that FM-symptom cluster. METHODS: A population-based sample of 8343 subjects of the older Finnish Twin Cohort replied to health questionnaires in 1975, 1981, and 1990. Their answers to the set of FM-symptom questions in 1990 classified them in three latent classes (LC): LC1 with no or few symptoms, LC2 with some symptoms, and LC3 with many FM symptoms. We analysed putative predictors for these symptom classes using baseline (1975 and 1981) data on regional pain, headache, migraine, sleeping, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking, and zygosity, adjusted for age, gender, and education. Those with a high likelihood of having fibromyalgia at baseline were excluded from the analysis. In the final multivariate regression model, regional pain, sleeping problems, and overweight were all predictors for membership in the class with many FM symptoms. RESULTS: The strongest non-genetic predictor was frequent headache (OR 8.6, CI 95Â % 3.8-19.2), followed by persistent back pain (OR 4.7, CI 95Â % 3.3-6.7) and persistent neck pain (OR 3.3, CI 95Â % 1.8-6.0). CONCLUSIONS: Regional pain, frequent headache, and persistent back or neck pain, sleeping problems, and overweight are predictors for having a cluster of symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia.Delirium is a common complication among the hospitalized elderly. Systemic analgesics are known precipitating factors for delirium. However, the risk from topical pain agents is not well documented. We report a case of a woman who developed delirium after the application of a lidocaine patch. While lidocaine patches are generally perceived as safe, clinicians should be aware of delirium as a potential adverse effect, particularly in older patients. This report also highlights the role of a systematic approach of staff education, use of a standardized protocol, and interdisciplinary communication in the identification and management of delirium in acute rehabilitation facilities.Pain catastrophizing may be assessed as a dispositional measure using a previous painful experience as a reference or as a situational measure using an actual ongoing pain as a reference. The latter has shown more robust correlations with pain-related outcomes; the relative influence of dispositional and situational pain catastrophizing remains unknown in relation to populations with no pain prior to surgery. Forty-two consecutive patients undergoing corrective surgery for funnel chest were asked to complete the Pain Catastrophizing Scale with reference to (1) a previous painful experience (dispositional pain catastrophizing); (2) experimental pain during a two-minute cold pressor test (situational-experimental pain catastrophizing); and (3) clinical pain three days after surgery (situational-clinical pain catastrophizing) to investigate whether these measures predicted immediate pain intensity and unpleasantness in the early postoperative period. Thirty-four patients were available for analyses. Dispositional pain catastrophizing was unrelated to situational-experimental and situational-clinical pain catastrophizing and to postoperative pain and unpleasantness (p>0.05). In contrast, the two situation-specific pain catastrophizing measures were strongly associated (Ï=0.59, p=0.0002). In analyses adjusted for preoperative anxiety, depression, and cold pressor pain sensitivity, situational-experimental and situational-clinical pain catastrophizing correlated with postoperative movement-evoked pain (b=1.36, p=0.01 and b=1.24, p=0.02, respectively) and unpleasantness (b=1.32, p=0.01 and b=1.36, p=0.01, respectively).PERSPECTIVE: Pain catastrophizing should be captured in relation to specific painful events in otherwise healthy patients. Future studies might benefit from assessing situational pain catastrophizing to identify patients at risk for increased postoperative pain to optimize stratified pain treatment.Extracellular pH variations are seen as the principal endogenous signal that triggers activation of Acid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs), which are basically considered as proton sensors, and are involved in various processes associated with tissue acidification. Here, we show that human painful inflammatory exudates, displaying non-acidic pH, induce a slow constitutive activation of human ASIC3 channels. This effect is largely driven by lipids, and we identify lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and arachidonic acid (AA) as endogenous activators of ASIC3 in the absence of any extracellular acidification. The combination of LPC and AA evokes robust depolarizing current in DRG neurons at physiological pH 7.4, increases nociceptive C-fiber firing, and induces pain behavior in rats, effects that are all prevented by ASIC3 blockers. Lipid-induced pain is also significantly reduced in ASIC3 knockout mice. These findings open new perspectives on the roles of ASIC3 in the absence of tissue pH variation, as well as on the contribution of those channels to lipid-mediated signaling.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with a first episode of acute pancreatitis can develop recurrent or chronic pancreatitis (CP). However, little is known about the incidence or risk factors for these events. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 669 patients with a first episode of acute pancreatitis admitted to 15 Dutch hospitals from December 2003 through March 2007. We collected information on disease course, outpatient visits, and hospital readmissions, as well as results from imaging, laboratory, and histology studies. Standardized follow-up questionnaires were sent to all patients to collect information on hospitalizations and interventions for pancreatic disease, abdominal pain, steatorrhea, diabetes mellitus, medications, and alcohol and tobacco use. Patients were followed for a median time period of 57 months. Primary endpoints were recurrent pancreatitis and CP. Risk factors were evaluated using regression analysis. The cumulative risk was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Recurrent pancreatitis developed 117 patients (17%) and CP in 51 patients (7.6%). Recurrent pancreatitis developed in 12% of patients with biliary disease, 24% of patients with alcoholic etiology, and 25% of patients with disease of idiopathic or other etiologies; CP occurred in 3%, 16% and 10% of these patients, respectively. Etiology, smoking, and necrotizing pancreatitis were independent risk factors for recurrent pancreatitis and CP. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores at admission were also independently associated with recurrent pancreatitis. The cumulative risk for recurrent pancreatitis over 5 years was highest among smokers (40%, compared to 13% for non-smokers). For alcohol abusers and current smokers, the cumulative risks for CP were similar-approximately 18%. In contrast, the cumulative risk of CP increased to 30% in patients who smoked and abused alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to Dutch hospitals, a first episode of acute pancreatitis leads to recurrent pancreatitis in 17% of patients, and almost 8% of patients progresses to CP within 5 years. Progression was independently associated with alcoholic etiology, smoking, and a history of pancreatic necrosis. Smoking is the predominant risk factor for recurrent disease, whereas the combination of alcohol abuse and smoking produces the highest cumulative risk for chronic pancreatitis.BACKGROUND: Tinospora cordifolia (T.Â cordifolia) is aÂ valuable resource due to its traditional uses in the treatment of pain, fever and inflammation, but no sufficient scientific literature is available online to confirm its traditional uses in these ailments. OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to validate the traditional uses of T.Â cordifolia in treating pain, inflammation and pyrexia, using albino mice as an experimental animal model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analgesic effects of T.Â cordifolia extract were assessed by using the acetic acid-induced writhing test, hot plate test and tail-flick test. The carrageenan test was performed to assess anti-inflammatory potential, and anti-pyretic activity was evaluated by the brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia method. RESULTS: The results showed that the T.Â cordifolia extract exhibited significant analgesic effects in aÂ dose-dependent manner in the three pain models tested. The extract also exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects in the carrageenan-induced inflammation test and antipyretic effects in the brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia test in dose-dependent manner compared to the effects observed in the control group animals. CONCLUSIONS: From the findings of the present study, it can be concluded that T.Â cordifolia extract has strong analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects. Further studies are required to investigate the therapeutic activities of the phytochemical constituents of T.Â cordifolia against pain, inflammation and pyrexia.BACKGROUND: While considering how important the interface between the amputees with the prostheses socket, we have carried out research to compare the gradient pressure occur at the interface socket that may lead to the discomforting effects to the user using common ICRC polypropylene socket and air splint socket. DESIGN: Not Applicable SETTING: Not Applicable POPULATION: The subject was a 23 year old who suffered a traumatic defect on the right arm caused by higher electrical volt. METHODS: F-Socket sensors have been used to measure dynamic socket interface pressure for the transradial amputee wearer during static and dynamic movements. The printed circuit with a thickness of 0.18 mm is equipped between the socket and the surface of the residual limb. Two F-Socket sensor is required to cover the entire socket surface attached to the residual limb. The average of 10 trials made on prosthetic user using both type of sockets for static and dynamic movements was recorded. RESULTS: The pressure gradient shows that the circumference of the socket interface for the ICRC polypropylene socket gives the most pressure distributions to the amputees compared to the pressure gradient for the air splint socket. CONCLUSION: The pressure gradient for ICRC socket increased consistently when the user makes movements while for the air splint socket remain constantly. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The specific interface pressure occur at the socket interface help in determine the comfort and pain of the socket design and improve the correlation between the user and the prosthesis.PURPOSE: To assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients participating in a randomised trial of neoadjuvant short course radiation (SC) or long course chemoradiation (LC) for operable rectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with T3N0-2M0 rectal cancer completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the colorectal cancer specific module (QLQ C38) at randomisation and 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months later. RESULTS: Of 326 patients randomised, 297 (SC 143, LC 154) were eligible for completion of HRQOL questionnaires. Baseline scores were comparable across the SC and LC groups. Patients reported low scores on sexual functioning and sexual enjoyment. Defaecation problems were the worst of the symptoms at baseline. Surgery had the most profoundly negative effect on HRQOL, seen in both the SC and LC treatment groups to the same extent. The most severely affected domains were physical function and role function and the most severely affected symptoms were fatigue, pain, appetite, weight loss and male sexual problems. Most domains and symptoms returned to baseline levels by 12 months apart from body image, sexual enjoyment and male sexual problems. Future perspective was better than prior to treatment. CONCLUSION: There is no overall difference in HRQOL between SC and LC neoadjuvant treatment strategies, in the first 12 months, after surgery. In the immediate postoperative period HRQOL was adversely affected in both groups but for the most part was temporary. Some residual sexual functioning concerns persisted at 12 months.PURPOSE: To report a case of chorioretinopathy, which preceded diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma. METHODS: Single patient case report. RESULTS: A 61-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer in remission and low-grade follicular lymphoma without criteria of high tumor burden presented with bilateral multifocal chorioretinopathy. The usual etiologies of chorioretinopathy were excluded, and subsequent onset of fever and back pain revealed the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The evolution of this case of ocular involvement was concordant with that of Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSION: The authors describe a case of Hodgkin's lymphoma postdating the onset of chorioretinopathy, emphasizing the need to research an underlying disorder when faced with any inflammatory intraocular disease, and the role of indocyanine green angiography in the diagnosis and follow-up of posterior uveitis.The prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in children in Ecuador is unknown. We describe a survey study in 2 schools in Quito, Ecuador, using a Spanish translation of the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III Version (QPGS-RIII). A total of 417 children (51% boys) with a mean age of 12.0 years were included. FGIDs were present in 95 children (22.8%) and occurred in 25% of girls and in 20.7% of boys (pâ=â0.296). Functional defecation disorders were found in 12.0 % of children, 9.4% had an abdominal pain related FGID and 3.8% was diagnosed with a vomiting or aerophagia FGID.BACKGROUND: Chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) is a chemokine released by mainly liver and blood leucocytes. Particularly under pro-inflammatory circumstances it triggers chemotaxis of lymphocytes and dendritic cells via activating receptor chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) that is specific to it. In experimental sepsis models, the chemokine-receptor pair has been identified as a potential pathophysiological axis affecting mortality. OBJECTIVE: Measurement of CCL20 and CCR6 plasma levels in septic patients compared with postsurgical, nonseptic patients. DESIGN: Case control study. SETTING: Surgical ICUs of the Department of Anaesthesiology, General Hospital of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. PATIENTS: Plasma levels were measured in 46 patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock according to current American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine criteria at the day of sepsis onset. Plasma levels in 36 postsurgical controls without sepsis admitted to the ICU were investigated. Plasma concentrations were determined by using commercially available ELISA kits. Data are given as median and interquartile range (IQR). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CCL20 and CCR6 plasma levels. RESULTS: CCL20 plasma levels were significantly increased in the sepsis group: 220.9âpgâml (IQR, 72.8 to 540.1) compared with the ICU controls: 37.0âpgâml (IQR 6.5 to 83.6) (Pâ<â0.0001). Significantly elevated CCR6 levels were found in the sepsis group: 2.47ângâml (IQR 0.92 to 5.54) compared with the controls: 0.59ângâml (IQR 0.17 to 1.48) (Pâ<â0.0001). Both CCL20 and CCR6 correlated with the maximum sequential organ failure assessment score (CCL20: Pâ<â0.0001, CCR6: Pâ<â0.0001). Length of ICU admission depended significantly on the logarithm of CCR6 (Pâ=â0.008) and sequential organ failure assessment maximum (Pâ<â0.0001). CONCLUSION: There were early increased plasma concentrations of CCL20 and CCR6 in patients with sepsis. CCL20 and CCR6 correlate with severity of illness in ICU patients. Levels of CCR6 predicted the length of patients' admission.PMID: 26771681  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]An important characteristic of a screening tool is its discriminant ability or the measure's accuracy to distinguish between those with and without mental health problems. The current study examined the inter-rater agreement and screening concordance of the parent and teacher versions of SDQ at scale, subscale and item-levels, with the view of identifying the items that have the most informant discrepancies; and determining whether the concordance between parent and teacher reports on some items has the potential to influence decision making. Cross-sectional data from parent and teacher reports of the mental health functioning of a community sample of 299 students with and without disabilities from 75 different primary schools in Perth, Western Australia were analysed. The study found that: a) Intraclass correlations between parent and teacher ratings of children's mental health using the SDQ at person level was fair on individual child level; b) The SDQ only demonstrated clinical utility when there was agreement between teacher and parent reports using the possible or 90% dichotomisation system; and c) Three individual items had positive likelihood ratio scores indicating clinical utility. Of note was the finding that the negative likelihood ratio or likelihood of disregarding the absence of a condition when both parents and teachers rate the item as absent was not significant. Taken together, these findings suggest that the SDQ is not optimised for use in community samples and that further psychometric evaluation of the SDQ in this context is clearly warranted.Glutamate is a neurotransmitter used at both the peripheral and central terminals of nociceptive primary sensory neurons, yet little is known concerning regulation of glutamate metabolism during peripheral inflammation. Glutaminase (GLS) is an enzyme of the glutamate-glutamine cycle that converts glutamine into glutamate for neurotransmission and is implicated in producing elevated levels of glutamate in central and peripheral terminals. A potential mechanism for increased levels of glutamate is an elevation in GLS expression. We assessed GLS expression after unilateral hind paw inflammation by measuring GLS immunoreactivity (ir) with quantitative image analysis of L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after one, two, four, and eight days of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) compared to saline injected controls. No significant elevation in GLS-ir occurred in the DRG ipsilateral to the inflamed hind paw after one or two days of AIA. After four days AIA, GLS-ir was elevated significantly in all sizes of DRG neurons. After eight days AIA, GLS-ir remained elevated in small (<400 ÂµmÂ²), presumably nociceptive neurons. Western blot analysis of the L4 DRG at day four AIA confirmed the elevated GLS-ir. The present study indicates that GLS expression is increased in the chronic stage of inflammation and may be a target for chronic pain therapy.Cancer patients who undergo surgery or radiation can develop persistent focal pain at the site of radiation or surgery. Twelve patients who had surgery or radiation for local cancer and failed at least two analgesic medications for pain control were prospectively enrolled in a research protocol. Patients were injected up to 100 units of incobotulinum toxin A (IncoA) intramuscularly or subcutaneously depending on the type and location of pain (muscle cramp or neuropathic pain). Two patients passed away, one dropped out due to a skin reaction and another patient could not return for the follow up due to his poor general condition. All remaining 8 subjects (Age 31-70, 4 female) demonstrated significant improvement of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (3 to 9 degrees, average 3.9 degrees) and reported significant satisfaction in Patients' Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC) (7 out of 8 reported the pain as much improved). Three of the 8 patients reported significant improvement of quality of life.INTRODUCTION: Byler disease (progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis) is associated metabolic bone disease as a consequence of chronic malabsorption. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old man with decompensated liver disease secondary to Byler disease was referred to the orthopaedic department with progressive pain over this right proximal tibia. On examination, he had an antalgic gait. Tenderness was localised to the proximal tibia just distal to the tibial tubercle and bilateral foot swelling. Radiographs showed multiple stress fractures characteristic of Looser zones at various stages of healing in both tibia, metatarsals (third, fourth, and fifth on the right side, and second and fourth on the left) and left femur. Bone mineral density was extremely low. Subsequent investigations were consistent with severe osteomalacia due to a combination of vitamin D deficiency and phosphaturia with elevated fibroblast factor 23 (FGF23). A good clinical response was achieved following supplementation with calcium 1000mg and vitamin D 20Î¼g daily. DISCUSSION: Stress fractures are often associated with delay in diagnosis. Our patient presented to the orthopaedic service with multiple Looser zones that had not been previously detected. As expected, there was biochemical evidence of vitamin D deficiency. An unexpected finding was phosphaturia that was associated with marked elevation in FGF23, which has never been reported previously. CONCLUSION: Byler disease may result in Looser zones of osteomalacia due to chronic malabsorption. Renal phosphorus wasting as a consequence of unexplained marked elevation in FGF23 is thought to have contributed to the onset of osteomalacia.OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of lumbar paraspinal muscles in adults with isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS), to compare them with those in the normative population, and to evaluate their correlations with demographic factors and MRI changes in various spinal elements. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective study of patients who had undergone posterior lumbar interbody fusion for IS, and 2 of the authors acting as independent observers calculated the CSAs of various lumbar paraspinal muscles (psoas, erector spinae [ES], multifidus [MF]) on preoperative axial T2-weighted MR images from the L-3 to L-5 vertebral levels and computed the CSAs as ratios with respect to the corresponding vertebral body areas. These values were then compared with those in an age- and sex-matched normative population and were analyzed with respect to age, sex, duration of symptoms, grade of listhesis, and various MRI changes at the level of the listhesis (pedicle signal change, disc degeneration, and facetal arthropathy). RESULTS Compared with values in normative controls, the mean CSA value for the ES muscle was significantly higher in the study cohort of 120 patients (p = 0.002), whereas that for the MF muscle was significantly lower (p = 0.009), and more so in the patients with PSC (p = 0.002). Magnetic resonance imaging signal change in the pedicle was seen in half of the patients, all of whom demonstrated a Type 2 change. Of the variables tested in a multivariate analysis, age independently predicted lower area values for all 3 muscles (p â¤ 0.001), whereas female sex predicted a lower mean psoas area value (p < 0.001). None of the other variables significantly predicted any of the muscle area values. A decrease in the mean MF muscle area value alone was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of a PSC (p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS Compared with normative controls, patients with IS suffer selective atrophy of their MF muscle, whereas their ES muscle undergoes a compensatory hypertrophy. Advancing age has a detrimental effect on the areas of the lumbar PSMs, whereas female sex predisposes to a decreased psoas muscle area. Multifidus muscle atrophy correlates with PSC, indicating the role of this deep stabilizer in the biomechanical stability of spondylolisthetic spines. This may be of clinical significance in targeted physiotherapy programs during the conservative management of IS.PMID: 26771298  [PubMed - in process]BACKGROUND: Unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a commonly performed procedure with significant expected postoperative pain. Peripheral nerve blocks are 1 analgesic option, but some approaches may decrease quadriceps motor strength and interfere with early ambulation. In this study, we compared the analgesia provided by an adductor canal block (ACB) and a psoas compartment block (PCB) after UKA. We hypothesized that the ACB would provide equivalent analgesia, defined as a difference of <2 points on the pain scale (0-10 numeric rating scale [NRS]), at rest and with movement 6 hours after block placement. METHODS: One hundred fifty patients undergoing medial UKA were randomly assigned to receive either an ACB or a PCB with 0.25% bupivacaine, 5 Î¼g/mL epinephrine, and 1.67 Î¼g/mL clonidine. All patients received multimodal analgesics, sham blockade at the alternate site, and a posterior capsule injection during surgery. Patients and observers were blinded to treatment groups. The primary end points were NRS pain scores with rest and movement at 6 hours. Secondary end points included quadriceps muscle strength at 6 hours (0-5 [5 being full strength]; Medical Research Council scale) as well as NRS pain scores, opioid consumption, and opioid-related side effects over 24 hours. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven patients were analyzed. Pain scores were equivalent at 6 hours with rest (ACB 1.0 Â± 2 vs PCB 1.1 Â± 2.2 [mean NRS Â± SD]; 95% confidence interval of mean difference, -0.8 to 0.6; P < 0.0001) and with movement (ACB 1.6 Â± 2.6 vs PCB 1.5 Â± 2.8; 95% confidence interval of mean difference, -0.8 to 0.9; P < 0.0001). In addition, pain scores at rest and with movement at 12, 18, and 24 hours were equivalent. Quadriceps motor strength was significantly increased in the ACB group (Medical Research Council scale score, 4.0 Â± 1.1 vs 2.5 Â± 1.3 [mean Â± SD]; P < 0.0001). No significant differences were found between groups for time to first analgesic or for cumulative opioid consumption at 6, 12, 18, or 24 hours. Other than an increase in the incidence of pruritus in the ACB group at 6 hours, there were no differences in opioid-related side effects. CONCLUSIONS: An ACB provides equivalent analgesia after medial UKA when compared with a PCB. In addition, the ACB caused significantly less motor weakness. An ACB should be considered for postoperative analgesia after medial UKA.BACKGROUND: It has been increasingly suggested that propofol protects against hypoxic-/ischemic-induced neuronal injury. As evidenced by hemorrhage-induced stroke, hemorrhage into the brain may also cause brain damage. Whether propofol protects against hemorrhage-induced brain damage remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of propofol on hemoglobin-induced cytotoxicity in cultured mouse cortical neurons. METHODS: Neurons were prepared from the cortex of embryonic 15-day-old mice. Hemoglobin was used to induce cytotoxicity in the neurons. The neurons were then treated with propofol for 4 hours. Cytotoxicity was determined by lactate dehydrogenase release assay. Caspase-3 activation was examined by Western blot analysis. Finally, the free radical scavenger U83836E was used to examine the potential involvement of oxidative stress in propofol's effects on hemoglobin-induced cytotoxicity. RESULTS: We found that treatment with hemoglobin induced cytotoxicity in the neurons. Propofol enhanced hemoglobin-induced cytotoxicity. Specifically, there was a significant difference in the amount of lactate dehydrogenase release between hemoglobin plus saline (19.84% Â± 5.38%) and hemoglobin plus propofol (35.79% Â± 4.41%) in mouse cortical neurons (P = 0.00058, Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test, n = 8 in the control group or the treatment group). U83836E did not attenuate the enhancing effects of propofol on hemoglobin-induced cytotoxicity in the neurons, and propofol did not significantly affect caspase-3 activation induced by hemoglobin. These data suggested that caspase-3 activation and oxidative stress might not be the underlying mechanisms by which propofol enhanced hemoglobin-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, these data suggested that the neuroprotective effects of propofol would be dependent on the condition of the brain injury, which will need to be confirmed in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: These results from our current proof-of-concept study should promote more research in vitro and in vivo to develop better anesthesia care for patients with hemorrhagic stroke.African hair braiders are potentially subject to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) because they perform repetitive hand motions for many hours a day together with prolonged standing and/or prolonged sitting. A complete enumeration of African hair braiders was attempted in Oklahoma City (OKC) and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW). Braiders were identified through the channels they typically use to offer services to clients. Potential risk factors and symptoms of WMSDs were assessed using an oral interview. Participation rates were 95% (18/19) in OKC and 83% (83/101) in DFW. More than 75% of braiders reported discomfort in the fingers, wrist/hand, upper back, and lower back. In multivariate analysis, years worked as a braider but not age was a significant risk factor (p < 0.005) for reported pain in the wrist/hand, time spent sitting during the work day was found to be a significant predictor (p < 0.05) of upper back pain and lower back pain, and time spent sitting and time spent standing during the work day were both significant predictors (p < 0.05) of shoulder pain. Braiders in OKC, where licensing requirements were stricter, were significantly more likely than braiders in DFW to work at home (67% vs. 4%, p < 0.001) and to report pain in the lower leg (p < 0.005) and ankle/foot (p < 0.05). The close-knit nature of the African hair braiding community makes it an appealing candidate for community-based participatory research aimed at further elucidating occupational health concerns and reducing risk.Peliosis hepatis is a rare condition that can cause hepatic hemorrhage, rupture, and ultimately liver failure. Several authors have reported that peliosis hepatis develops in association with chronic wasting disease or prolonged use of anabolic steroids or oral contraceptives. In this report we describe a case in which discontinuation of steroid therapy improved the condition of a patient with peliosis hepatis. Our patient was a 64-year-old woman with a history of long-term steroid treatment for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura . Her symptoms included abdominal pain and weight loss; the only finding of a physical examination was hepatomegaly. We performed computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver and a liver biopsy. Based on these findings plus clinical observations, she was diagnosed with peliosis hepatis and her steroid treatment was terminated. The patient recovered completely 3 months after steroid discontinuation, and remained stable over the following 6 months.Chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) may involve any organ system, but male genital involvement is rare. Peyronie's Disease (PD) is an acquired, localized fibrotic disorder of the tunica albuginea, which leads to penile deformity, pain, and eventually to erectile dysfunction. We report the case of a 52 year old African American male with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who underwent human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling allogeneic peripheral blood SCT. His post transplant course was complicated by development of acute and multi-organ chronic GvHD requiring prolonged immunosuppression. He developed progressive dorsal curvature of the penis with erections within 1 year of ultra low dose interleukin -2 (IL2) treatment for his chronic GvHD but concealed symptoms for several months. Color Doppler Duplex ultrasound evaluation of the erect penis revealed a 75-degree curvature and appropriate hemodynamic response to prostaglandin injection. He underwent successful incision and grafting of the penile plaque. There is no significant residual curvature and is now able to engage in intercourse. A strong temporal association between GVHD (or its treatment) and Peyronie's is documented here. Awareness of the possible link between PD and chronic GVHD is required in this era of rapid growth in numbers of SCT.Peyronie's disease (PD) is a chronic disorder involving the tunica albuginea surrounding the corpora cavernosa of the penis. A conservative treatment is indicated in the first stage of disease. The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic impact and possible side effects of treatment with pentoxifylline (PTX) in combination with other antioxidants in 307 patients with early-stage PD. Patients were subdivided into three groups: A, B, and C. Both groups, A and B, comprising of 206 patients, underwent treatment, whereas Group C was the control group (n=101). Treatment lasted 6 months and included the following: Group A: PTX 400 mg twice a day + propolis 600 mg/d + blueberry 160 mg/d + vitamin E 600 mg/d + diclofenac 4% gel twice/a day + PTX 100 mg via perilesional penile injection/every other week (12 injections in all); Group B: the same treatment as Group A except for the penile PTX injections. After the 6-month treatment course, we obtained the following results: actual mean decrease in plaque volume -46.9% and -24.8% in Group A and B, respectively (P<0.0001); mean curvature reduction -10.1Â° and -4.8Â°, respectively (P,0.0001); resolution of pain in 67.6% and 67.2% of cases, respectively (P=0.961); recovery of normal penile rigidity in 56.09% and 23.5% of cases, respectively (P=0.005). After 6 months, progression of disease was observed in all patients belonging to Group C: plaque volume +123.3%; curvature +15.7Â°; no recovery of penile rigidity. The statistically significant results of our study show that multimodal treatment with PTX in association with other antioxidants and topical diclofenac is efficacious in treating early-stage PD. Furthermore, treatment proved to be more effective when PTX was administered both orally and by penile injection. No serious adverse effects occurred.Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. Mesalizine for the first-line therapy of UC has adverse effects include pancreatitis, pneumonia and pericarditis. UC complicated by two coexisting conditions, however, is very rare. Moreover, drug-related pulmonary toxicity is particularly rare. An 11-year-old male patient was hospitalized for recurring upper abdominal pain after meals with vomiting, hematochezia and exertional dyspnea developing at 2 weeks of mesalizine therapy for UC. The serum level of lipase was elevated. Chest X-ray and thorax computed tomography showed interstitial pneumonitis. Mesalizine was discontinued and steroid therapy was initiated. Five days after admission, symptoms were resolved and mesalizine was resumed after a drop in amylase and lipase level. Symptoms returned the following day, however, accompanied by increased the serum levels of amylase and lipase. Mesalizine was discontinued again and recurring symptoms rapidly improved.Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is defined as pancreatic tissue lacking anatomic and vascular continuity with the main body of the pancreas. Most are asymptomatic, but can cause ulcer, bleeding, intussusception, and mechanical obstruction. Herein, we presented one case of HP presented as duodenal tumor causing duodenal obstruction. A 7-year-old girl visited the emergency room for abdominal pain with vomiting for 24 hours. Computed tomography and upper gastrointestinal series revealed a polypoid mass with short stalk in the 2nd portion of duodenum. We attempted an endoscopic removal. However, the lumen was nearly obstructed by the mass and the stalk was too broad and hard to excise. The mass was surgically removed via duodenotomy. It was confirmed as a HP with ductal and acini components (type 2 by Heinrich classification). Postoperatively, the patient has been well without any complication and recurrence.PURPOSE: Pediatric chest pain is considered to be idiopathic or caused by benign diseases. This study was to find out how much upper gastrointestinal (UGI) diseases are major causes of chest pain in pediatric patients. METHODS: The records of 75 children (42 boys and 33 girls, aged 3-17 years old) who have presented with mainly chest pain from January 1995 to March 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Chest X-ray and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed in all aptients. Further cardiologic and gastrointestinal (GI) evaluations were performed in indicated patients. RESULTS: Chest pain was most common in the children of 6 and 9 to 14 years old. Esopha-gogastric diseases were unexpectedly the most common direct causes of the chest pain, the next are idiopathic, cardiac diseases, chest trauma, respiratory disease, and psychosomatic disease. Even though 21 showed abnormal ECG findings and 7 showed abnormalities on echocardiography, cardiac diseases were determined to be the direct causes only in 9. UGI endoscopy was performed in 57 cases, and esophago-gastric diseases which thereafter were thought to be causative diseases were 48 cases. The mean age of the children with esophago-gastric diseases were different with marginal significance from that of the other children with chest pain not related with esophago-gastric diseases. All the 48 children diagnosed with treated with GI medicines based on the diagnosis, and 37 cases (77.1%) subsequently showed clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic approaches to find out esophageal and gastric diseases in children with chest pain are important as well as cardiac and respiratory investigations.PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical features and outcome of eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) in children. METHODS: Our study enrolled 24 children who were diagnosed with EGE from 1993 to 2014 at the Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University Children's Hospital. The patients' clinical manifestations, treatments, and outcomes were reviewed from the medical records. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 5.3 years. Most patients had gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea (54.2%) and abdominal pain (45.8%). Peripheral eosinophilia was present in 91.7% of the patients. Thirteen patients (54.2%) showed anemia, and 15 patients (62.5%) had hypoalbuminemia. EGE was classified as mucosal, subserosal, or muscular in 75.0%, 20.8%, and 4.2% of cases, respectively. Three patients showed gastroduodenal ulcers upon endoscopic analysis. A history of allergy was reported in 13 patients, including atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Five patients (20.8%) improved with food restrictions. Among the 19 patients treated with steroids, 11 (57.9%) discontinued steroid treatment without subsequent relapse, 4 (21.1%) relapsed after ceasing steroid treatment, and 4 (21.1%) showed no response to steroids. Two patients who were resistant to steroids underwent therapeutic surgery. The presence of gastroduodenal ulcers was significantly associated with relapse and steroid resistance. CONCLUSION: A high suspicion of EGE is warranted when children have nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral eosinophilia. Most patients improved with food restrictions or steroid treatment, although one-third of patients showed a relapse or steroid resistance.The mechanism of Western medicine that is commonly used for pain relief is well-known. However, very little is known for oriental herbs, and even less is known for mixture of the two. We investigated the combinational effect of 3 kinds of oriental herbs, usually used for the control of headache, and acetaminophen to relieve headache in microglia cell line, BV2. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation induced to produce nitrite and increased the expression of inflammation-related factors like inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in murine microglia cell line, BV2. Oriental herbs such as Angelica tenuissima, Angelica dahurica, and Scutellaria baicalensis reduced the production of nitric oxide and the expression of COX-2. Moreover, a treatment of acetaminophen combined with oriental herbs was more decreased the COX-2 expression, and its product, prostaglandin E2 production in BV2 cells. Therefore, a combined treatment of oriental herbs such as A. tenuissima, A. dahurica, and S. baicalensis and Western medicine like acetaminophen has a synergistic effect on the decrease of LPS-induced inflammation in microglia.A 21-year-old male suffering from severe throat pain after being hit by a bullet in Syria claimed that he was shot through his eye and that the bullet subsequently descended behind his throat. Even though the first medical report stated that this course is implausible, meticulous workup provided evidence that the bullet might have entered the parapharyngeal space in a more cranial position than the one it was found eight months later. Our case highlights that bullets are able to move within the body, rendering ballistic reconstruction difficult. However, after removal of the bullet the patient's symptoms completely resolved.Paraspinal and epidural abscesses are rare conditions often diagnosed later in the disease process that can have significant morbidity and mortality. Predisposing risk factors include diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, intravenous drug abuse, and previous history of spinal surgery or injection. They can threaten the spinal cord by compressive effect, leading to sensory motor deficits and ultimately paralysis and death. Diagnosis may be a challenge due to the delayed presentation of nonspecific back pain or radicular pain such as chest pain or abdominal pain. We present a rare case on a patient with periumbilical pain, constipation, and urinary retention who was ultimately diagnosed with a paraspinal abscess extending into the epidural space from T1 to S2. He underwent decompressive laminectomy with incision and drainage of the abscesses. The patient made an excellent recovery postoperatively, and repeat magnetic resonance imaging at six weeks showed resolution of the abscess.A 22-year-old woman recently diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) was admitted to the department of cardiology due to chest pain and shortness of breath. The ECG showed widespread mild PR-segment depression, upwardly convex ST-segment elevation, and T-wave inversion. The troponin T level was elevated at 550âng/L. Transthoracic echocardiography showed basal inferoseptal thinning and hypokinesis, mild pericardial effusion, and an overall preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Global longitudinal strain, however, was clearly reduced. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed findings consistent with myocarditis but the etiology of the apical hypokinesis could not be determined with certainty and may well have been due to a myocardial infarction, a notion supported by a coronary angiogram displaying slow flow in the territory of the left anterior descending artery. Finally, an endomyocardial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis. The cardiac symptoms subsided upon treatment with high-dose prednisolone and rituximab.The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine protein kinase, integrates extracellular signals, thereby modulating several physiological and pathological processes, including pain. Previous studies have suggested that rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) can attenuate nociceptive behaviors in many pain models, most likely at the spinal cord level. However, the mechanisms of mTOR at the supraspinal level, particularly at the level of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), remain unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of mTOR in the RVM, a key relay region for the descending pain control pathway, under neuropathic pain conditions. Phosphorylated mTOR was mainly expressed in serotonergic spinally projecting neurons and was significantly increased in the RVM after spared nerve injury- (SNI-) induced neuropathic pain. Moreover, in SNI rat brain slices, rapamycin infusion both decreased the amplitude instead of the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and reduced the numbers of action potentials in serotonergic neurons. Finally, intra-RVM microinjection of rapamycin effectively alleviated established mechanical allodynia but failed to affect the development of neuropathic pain. In conclusion, our data provide strong evidence for the role of mTOR in the RVM in nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, indicating a novel mechanism of mTOR inhibitor-induced analgesia.Trigeminal Neuralgia is a disorder that is characterized with electrical-type shocking pain in the face and jaw. This pain may either present as sharp unbearable pain unilateral or bilaterally. There is no definite etiology for this condition. There are various treatment methods that are currently being used to relieve the pain. One of the pharmacological treatments is Carbamazepine and the most prevalent surgical treatments include Gamma Knife Surgery (GKS), Microvascular Decompression (MVD) and Radiofrequency Lesioning (RFL). Although, MVD is the most used surgical method it is not an option for all the patients due to the intensity of the procedure. RFL is used when MVD is not suitable. In this paper we present the various treatments and Monte-Carlo based pharmacokinetic simulations of Carbamazepine in treatment of Trigeminal Neuralgia.Pyogenic liver abscesses are caused by various microorganisms and usually present with fever, abdominal pain, leukocytosis and liver enzyme abnormalities. This case presents the insidious manifestation of a pyogenic liver abscess in a 34-year-old immunocompetent male, where classical manifestations of a liver abscess were absent. The microorganisms cultured from the abscess belonged to oral cavity's and gastrointestinal tract's normal flora.OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of oral sucrose on procedural pain, and on biochemical markers of adenosine triphosphate utilization and oxidative stress in preterm neonates with mild to moderate respiratory distress. STUDY DESIGN: Preterm neonates with a clinically required heel lance that met study criteria (nâ=â49) were randomized into three groups: (1) control (nâ=â24), (2) heel lance treated with placebo and non-nutritive sucking (nâ=â15) and (3) heel lance treated with sucrose and non-nutritive sucking (nâ=â10). Plasma markers of adenosine triphosphate degradation (hypoxanthine, xanthine and uric acid) and oxidative stress (allantoin) were measured before and after the heel lance. Pain was measured using the Premature Infant Pain Profile. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance, chi-square and one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: We found that in preterm neonates who were intubated and/or were receiving â©¾30% FiO2, a single dose of oral sucrose given before a heel lance significantly increased markers of adenosine triphosphate use. CONCLUSION: We found that oral sucrose enhanced adenosine triphosphate use in neonates who were intubated and/or were receiving â©¾30% FiO2. Although oral sucrose decreased pain scores, our data suggest that it also increased energy use as evidenced by increased plasma markers of adenosine triphosphate utilization. These effects of sucrose, specifically the fructose component, on adenosine triphosphate metabolism warrant further investigation.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of two different physical therapy interventions in patients with stable coronary heart disease and non-cardiac chest pain. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was carried out at a university hospital in Norway. A total of 30 patients with known and stable coronary heart disease and self-reported persistent chest pain reproduced by palpation of intercostal trigger points were participating in the study. The intervention was deep friction massage and heat pack versus heat pack only. The primary outcome was pain intensity after the intervention period and 3 months after the last treatment session, measured by Visual Analogue Scale, 0 to 100. Secondary outcome was health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Treatment with deep friction massage and heat pack gave significant pain reduction compared to heat pack only (-17.6, 95% confidence interval: -30.5, -4.7; p < 0.01), and the reduction was persistent at 3 months' follow-up (-15.2, 95% confidence interval: -28.5, -1.8; p = 0.03). Health-related quality of life improved in all three domains in patients with no significant difference between groups. CONCLUSION: Deep friction massage combined with heat pack is an efficient treatment of musculoskeletal chest pain in patients with stable coronary heart disease.The number of attendances and admissions of patients with chest pain to hospitals in England and Wales is increasing. Initial assessment may be unrewarding. Consequently, cardiac troponin has become the mainstay of investigation for non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina, although only a small proportion of patients are eventually diagnosed as such. Current National Institute for Healthcare and Clinical Excellence guidance recommends measuring cardiac troponin levels on presentation and 10-12âh after onset of symptoms. A more effective diagnostic tool is needed. The aims are twofold: to increase accuracy of acute coronary syndrome diagnosis thus implementing the most appropriate management at an earlier stage while reducing costs and to provide a more rapid diagnosis to ease the anxieties of patients. Three key issues have been highlighted. The first is that many current studies do not have a 'normal/reference' population, making comparison between two studies difficult to interpret. Second, whether newer 'high-sensitivity' cardiac troponin tests can be used to rule out a myocardial infarction in a patient with chest pain is discussed. Third, whether a 'high-sensitivity' cardiac troponin has great enough specificity to differentiate between the number of other causes of raised troponin in a single test or whether serial testing is needed is assessed. A strategy for such serial testing is discussed. Finally, use of 'high-sensitivity' cardiac troponin in risk stratification of other disease processes is highlighted, which is likely to become common practice, changing the way we manage patients with, and without, chest pain.OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to assess the warming sensation caused by IFF Flavour 316282 in a syrup used for short-term treatment by patients suffering from nasal congestion and mild to moderate body pain, headache, fever or sore throat associated with an upper respiratory tract infection. METHODS: A single cohort, single treatment arm, open-label study. Subjects received one 30âmL dose of syrup containing IFF Flavour 316282, paracetamol and pseudoephedrine and recorded onset and disappearance of any warming sensation in the mouth/throat. Subjects' assessments of strength and appeal of the sensation, taste, texture and acceptability of the product was investigated using questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 56 subjects were included; 53 (94.6%) experienced a warming sensation. The median duration of the warming sensation was 114âs (95% confidence interval: 87-120âs). All subjects rated the syrup as excellent, good or fair for treating their symptoms; 100% and 94.6% of subjects respectively described texture and taste as excellent, good or fair. There were no safety concerns, and the syrup was well tolerated. Most subjects liked the warming sensation. CONCLUSIONS: IFF Flavour 316282 in a syrup for treatment of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms is associated with a warming sensation. The syrup is well tolerated, safe and palatable.Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPARÎ±) confers cardioprotection, while its mechanism remains elusive. We investigated the protective effect of PPARÎ± activation against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury in terms of the expression of uncoupling protein (UCP). Myocardial infarct size and UCP expression were measured in rats treated with WY-14643 20âmg/kg, a PPARÎ± ligand, or vehicle. WY-14643 increased UCP3 expression in vivo. Myocardial infarct size was decreased in the WY-14643 group (76 Â± 8% versus 42 Â± 12%, P<0.05). During reperfusion, the incidence of arrhythmia was higher in the control group compared with the WY-14643 group (9/10 versus 3/10, P<0.05). H9c2 cells were incubated for 24âh with WY-14643 or vehicle. WY-14643 increased UCP3 expression in H9c2 cells. WY-14643 decreased hypoxia-stimulated ROS production. Cells treated with WY-14643 were more resistant to hypoxia-reoxygenation than the untreated cells. Knocking-down UCP3 by siRNA prevented WY-14643 from attenuating the production of ROS. UCP3 siRNA abolished the effect of WY-14643 on cell viability against hypoxia-reoxygenation. In summary, administration of PPARÎ± agonist WY-14643 mitigated the extent of myocardial infarction and incidence of reperfusion-induced arrhythmia. PPARÎ± activation conferred cytoprotective effect against hypoxia-reoxygenation. Associated mechanisms involved increased UCP3 expression and resultant attenuation of ROS production.Fibrous dysplasia is a kind of benign bone lesion characterized by the manifestation of the replacement of the normal substance of bone by fibro-osseous connective tissue. A patient diagnosed fibrous dysplasia had unbearable pain in the left mandibular region only. To treat the patient, an navigation template was designed to guide the decompression of inferior alveolar nerve, and piezosurgery was performed to do the osteotomy. After the surgery, the pain disappeared. The sensation of the lower lip recovered.Some reports have demonstrated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment for patients who suffer from intractable anorexia nervosa. However, the nature of DBS may not be viewed as a standard clinical treatment option for anorexia nervosa because of the unpredictable outcome before DBS. Just like DBS in the brain, electroacupuncture at acupoints is also efficient in treating refractory anorexia nervosa. Some neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET) had revealed that both DBS and electroacupuncture at acupoints with electrical stimulation are related to the changes in cerebral glucose metabolism. Therefore, we hypothesize that the changes in cerebral glucose metabolism after electroacupuncture might be useful to predict the therapeutic effect of deep brain stimulation for refractory anorexia nervosa.In recent years, fatigue is common among adolescents. The aim of this study is to evaluate fatigue status and find related factors of fatigue among students ranged from 13-26 years from Wuhu, China. This is a case-control, cross-sectional observational study. The students from six middle schools (high school? 26 years old?) in Wuhu city were recruited, Self-Rating Fatigue Scale (SFS) was used to measure the fatigue status among students ranged from 13-26 years, and some demographic characteristics of students also was determined. A total of 726 students are included in our study. A significant difference was observed between fatigue status and grade, a balanced diet, the partial eclipse, picky for food, lack of sleep, excessive fatigue, drinking (P < 0.05). The risk factors of fatigue status include myopia, partial eclipse, picky for food, lacking of sleep, drinking; grade while a balanced diet is the protective factor of fatigue. Therefore, the school should pay more attention to the fatigue among students in middle school in China, and take some properly measures to reduce the fatigue.PURPOSE: To analyze the correlation of clinical symptom and endoscopic-pathological characteristics of colorectal polyps. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 1,234 continuous colorectal polyp patients. Their clinical, colonoscopic and pathological data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In 1,234 patients, 46.0% cases were asymptomatic, and 54.0% cases were symptomatic, and the female to male ratio was 2.23:1 and 1.74:1, respectively (P = 0.048). The mean polyp size in symptomatic group was significantly larger than asymptomatic group [7.6Â±5.1 mm (95% CI: 7.2, 8.0) vs. 6.3Â±3.7 mm (95% CI: 6.0, 6.6), P < 0.001]. Tubu-villous polyp and villous polyp occurred more frequently in symptomatic group, compared with asymptomatic group (P = 0.002). In symptomatic group, 37.4% cases complained of abdominal pain and 62.6% cases complained of bowel habit alteration. The polyp number in abdominal pain group was larger than bowel habit alteration group (P = 0.036). Three major symptoms of bowel habit alteration were diarrhea, constipation and hematochezia, with proportion of 54.2% (278/513), 27.7% (142/513) and 18.1% (93/513), respectively. The hematochezia group had larger polyp size than diarrhea group (P = 0.001) and consisted of more villous component than the constipation patients (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Almost half of colorectal polyp patients do not complain of bowel symptoms, especially the male. Colorectal polyp patients have bowel habit alteration more commonly than abdominal pain. Half of patients with bowel habit alteration demonstrate diarrhea. The hematochezia patients are more susceptible to advanced adenomas than the diarrhea and constipation ones.AIM: We aimed to evaluate the hemostatic effects and the clinical outcomes of preoperative and postoperative cryoceutical treatment (C-tx) following total knee arthroplasty. PATIENTS AND METHOD: 42 patients received C-tx both preoperatively, and postoperatively. In the control group, 45 patients did not receive any C-tx. Amount of bloody drainage and verbal rating pain scores were noted. RESULTS: We found significant difference in both the preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels and blood drainage (P<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the average verbally rated pain scores (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: C-tx performed preoperatively and postoperatively for total knee arthroplasty is effective in decreasing perioperative and postoperative hemorrhage. However, it had no superior effect on the control of postoperative pain.OBJECTIVE: Continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB), guided by ultrasound combined nerve stimulations, offers advantages for both sides and provides effective postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the medium-term impact of continuous femoral nerve block on knee function and quality of life in patients following TKA. METHODS: This was a follow-up study. Total 168 adult patients scheduled for elective TKA were randomly allocated to receive postoperative continuous femoral nerve block guided by ultrasound combined nerve stimulator (group CFNB, n = 82) or patient-controlled epidural analgesia (group PCEA, n = 86). Quality of life, knee function, patient satisfaction, pain medication and associated adverse effects were compared at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Quality of life was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey (MOS SF-36), and clinical results were assessed using the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Knee Scoring System. Patient satisfaction scores were divided into four categories. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients completed the 12-month follow-up. The CFNB group patients had significantly improved SF-36 scores and physical function at 1 month postoperatively (P < 0.05); the remaining seven dimensions were similar between the two groups. No differences were observed at 3, 6 or 12 months. HSS scores for the four observational time points were comparable. The CFNB group patients reported less pain; improved knee function, maximum flexion and strength; less celecoxib consumption and fewer side effects at 1 month than the PCEA group patients. The satisfaction score at 12 months decreased significantly, compared with that at 1 month in both groups (3.6 to 2.95 and 3.4 to 2.45, respectively). No difference in satisfaction score was observed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous femoral nerve block not only could provide effective postoperative analgesia but also could improve joint function and quality of life in patients at one month postoperatively. Continuous femoral nerve block is a good choice for postoperative analgesia after TKA.PURPOSE: Few studies have investigated the efficacy of silodosin, a recently introduced selective alpha 1-A adrenoceptor antagonist, in medical expulsive therapy (MET) for ureteral calculi. The results of these studies, which all evaluated the efficacy of 8 mg/day, indicate that silodosin is a potential treatment for ureteral calculi. This study investigated the efficacy of 4 mg/day of silodosin for MET of distal ureteral stones 4 to 10 mm in diameter. MATERIAL AND METHOD: After 70 patients had been randomized into 2 groups of 35 patients each, both the control and experimental groups (groups 1 and 2, respectively) were advised to take 75 mg/day of diclofenacsodiumas needed for pain relief but only the experimental group to take 4 mg/day of silodosin. After 21 days, the groups were compared regarding the stone expulsion rate and duration, number of renalcolicepisodes, and analgesicdosage. RESULTS: The median expulsion rates were 71.4% and 91.4% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and the difference between them was significant (P=0.031). The median expulsion durations were 12.91Â±6.14 and 8.03Â±4.99 days, respectively, and the difference between them was significant (P<0.001). No significant differences were found regarding the median number of renal colic episodes or median analgesic dosage. While no patients in group 1 experienced side effects, 5 patients (14%) in group 2 experienced retrograde ejaculation. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that 4 mg/day of silodos in facilitates the expulsion of distal ureteral stones 4 to 10 mm in diameter but does not significantly reduce the number of renal colic episodes or analgesic dosage.BACKGROUND: To assess the efficacy of Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation with high-intensity compared with low-intensity on knee osteoarthritis (KOA). METHODS: Participants with KOA were randomized to either high-intensity EA group or low-intensity EA group. EA was applied unilaterally on the affected leg with the local points GB34, ST34, EX-LE4, EX-LE5, ST36, and SP9. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were measured before and after participation. Plasma TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-6, and apelin levels were also assessed by enzyme immunoassay (ELA) before and after treatment. RESULTS: Of 80 participants who consented to study participation, 77 completed the program. The patients showed a significant improvement in their pain, stiffness, and physical function on the VAS and WOMAC, accompanying with a significantly reduction in plasma levels of apelin and TNFÎ±. Furthermore, high-intensity group exhibited statistically significant improvements in stiffness and physical function symptoms compared with low-intensity group. Plasma level of IL-6 was significantly decreased only after high-intensity EA treatment. Furthermore, apelin level was significantly inhibited in high-intensity EA group than in low-intensity EA group. CONCLUSIONS: Both high- and low-intensity EA treatments alleviate the clinical symptoms of KOA patients. High-intensity EA is more effective than low-intensity EA. Changes in plasma levels of TNFÎ±, apelin and IL-6 may be involved in the therapeutic effect of EA on KOA.The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and complications and compare the efficacy of medical thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis among patients with different types of tumors and different pathological classifications of lung cancer as well as to evaluate the role of postoperative negative pressure chest tube drainage. A total of 1061 patients with malignant pleural effusion who underwent thoracoscopic pleurodesis were analyzed retrospectively. The complications, postoperative drainage time, and efficacy of pleurodesis among patients with different types of tumors and different pathological classifications of lung cancer were assessed. The overall response rate (ORR) was 88.03%. Major complications included chest pain (68%) and fever (47%). The postoperative drainage time was 4.74 Â± 1.56 days. Postoperative negative pressure chest tube drainage significantly shortened the drainage time (negative vs. non-negative: 4.56 Â± 1.49 days vs. 4.81 Â± 1.59 days, P = 0.037). Pleurodesis was less effective in treating effusion caused by lung cancer (72.3%) and mesothelioma (68.2%) than that caused by breast cancer (84.4%) and other tumors (87.8%) (P = 0.009). The efficacy in the treatment of effusion caused by adenocarcinoma (66.7%) was slightly less than that caused by other types of lung cancer (P = 0.311). In conclusion, medical thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis is a palliative and effective treatment for malignant pleural effusion. In addition, postoperative simple negative pressure chest tube drainage significantly shortens the drainage time. However, thoracoscopic pleurodesis is less effective for the treatment of effusion caused by lung cancer and pleural mesothelioma compared with that caused by other types of cancers.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the short-term results of intra-articular platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) administrations in early knee osteoarthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighteen patients (mean age: 59.3Â±8.55) who were clinically and radiologically documented with a knee osteoarthritis diagnosis between May and December 2013 were evaluated. For the radiological evaluation, the Kellgren-Lawrence radiological classification scale was employed. The data of stage 1 and 2 patients with osteoarthritis were gathered retrospectively according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. The patients were given intra-articular PRP or HA treatments a total of three times, one week apart. 61 patients (102 knees) were involved in the PRP group, and 57 patients (97 knees) were involved in the HA group. The patients were evaluated using the Knee Society's Knee Scoring System (KSS) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scoring system before the treatment and at three and six months after the treatment. RESULTS: In the PRP and HA groups, when pre-treatment KSS and VAS scores were compared with post-treatment three and six-month scores, a statistically significant difference was seen. When the groups were compared with each other, there was no significant difference between pre-treatment KSS and VAS pain scores; however, a significant difference was found between post-treatment three and six-month scores. CONCLUSION: In this study, the intra-articular PRP administration was more efficient than the HA administration in early knee osteoarthritis.BACKGROUND: The most critical thing in breast augmentation surgery is to determine the location for implant placement. However, few researches on this were carried out in China. We therefore conducted this retrospective study to compare the recovery period, complications and patient satisfaction at two different implant placement locations-the subglandular plane and the subpectoral plane. METHODS: A total of 144 patients were included. All of them have undergone primary aesthetic breast augmentation with cohesive silicone gel implant. Then they were divided into two groups according to the implant location: group A (in the subglandular plane) and group B (in the subpectoral plane). Data collected were patient data, surgery-related indicators, recovery, complications and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were assigned to group A, and 105 patients to group B. In terms of patient data, no significant difference was found in age, follow-up time and the size of prosthesis between the two groups, but there existed statistically significant difference in body mass index (BMI) and the preoperative mammary tissue thickness (P < 0.05). For surgery-related indicators and recovery, group A was better than group B in surgical blood loss, duration of pain and indwelling drainage tube, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). But regarding the complications, significant difference was found only in the nipple-areola numbness (P < 0.05). Overall, 76% of the patients reported they were "satisfied" with the outcome or the outcome was "perfect". CONCLUSION: Implant placement in the subglandular plane has a shorter recovery period than that in the subpectoral plane. The occurrence of complications and degree of patient satisfaction are similar in the two groups.The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of pressurized salt ice packs (PIP) with water ice packs (WIP) which are used to relieve pain and decrease swelling on patients following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Sixty-nine patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA were randomly divided into two groups (PIP group and WIP group). We used a visual analog scale (VAS) to score knee pain and the score was recorded. The knee bilateral girth, the slipping times of the ice pack, and the times of wound dressing or bed moist were recorded during cryotherapy. The scores of pain between the two groups were significant difference in 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after TKA (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found for the girth measurements of the operative knee on the two levels in 12 h, 24 h and 72 h, respectively. However, there was statistically difference for girth measurements between the two groups in 48 h after TKA (P < 0.05). PIP is a cheap, safe and simple method, which is more effective than WIP on reducing pain and swelling degree of patients. Thus, PIP is recommended in clinical nursing work.One-bone forearm functions best when the proximal ulna and distal radius are present and joined (the ulnius). Six open forearm fractures accompanied by segmental radial defect were treated by the ulnius formation in a one-stage procedure. All patients had a stable and pain-free forearm, and were satisfied with the function and cosmetic appearance of the forearm.BACKGROUND: Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block and local anaesthetic wound infiltration can provide effective pain relief at the wound site after surgery. However, the relative efficacy of two techniques for postoperative analgesia remains controversial. METHODS: We searched PUBMED, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAP block with wound infiltration for pain relief after surgery. The primary outcomes were pain scores at rest and on movement at 1, 8 and 24 hours postoperatively and cumulative morphine consumption over 24 hours. The secondary outcomes were time to first rescue analgesic, number of rescue analgesic use and opioids-related side-effects. RESULTS: Nine RCTs with a total of 500 participants were included. TAP block was associated with significant lower rest and dynamic pain scores at 8 hour [MD = -1.08, 95% CI (-1.89-0.26), P = 0.009] and 24 hour [MD = -0.83, 95% CI (-1.60, -0.06), P = 0.03] postoperatively than wound infiltration, but no significant difference was found at 1 hour [MD = -0.94, 95% CI (-1.97, 0.09), P = 0.08] postoperatively. In adults, TAP block significantly reduced 24-hour overall morphine consumption by 3.85 mg [MD = -3.85, 95% CI (-7.47, -0.22), P = 0.04] compared with wound infiltration. Subgroup analysis showed that adults received TAP block appeared to have lower rest pain scores at 24 hour than children (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: TAP block provides superior analgesia compared with wound infiltration in the setting of a multimodal analgesic regimen. Subgroup analysis indicated that adults may have benefits additional to the analgesic effect than children.Orthopaedic involvement is the most common clinical presentation of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) patients with the spinal abnormalities more frequently affected. In the spinal deformities of NF-1 patients, despite the scoliosis is the most frequent finding, several distinctive radiographic features, such as dural ectasia, defective pedicles, and spondylolisthesis, are relatively less common. Here, we reported a 16-year-old boy diagnosed with NF-1 who presented with dural ectasia, defective pedicles, and spondylolisthesis concomitantly, described the surgical treatment and provided a literature review. The boy complained of low back and leg pain for two months. On clinical examination, the patient showed multiple cafÃ© au lait spots on his back and no neurological deficit. He had a family history of neurofibromatosis as his father suffering from NF-1. Imaging results demonstrated mild scoliosis, posterior scalloping of the lumber spine, L5 spondylolisthesis on plain radiographs, and marked dural ectasia of L3-L5 on MRI. Furthermore, the CT scan showed presence of thin pedicles at L3, bilateral symmetrical pedicle clefts at L4, and pars interarticularis fractures at L5. The patient received a long level posterior fusion from L1 to S1 with pedicle screws. Iliac crest autogenous graft mixed with artificial bone were used to achieve solid arthrodesis. At nine-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and able to live a normal life. Our observation demonstrated that familiarity with those distinctive features in NF-1 patients could be contributed to making an early diagnosis and optimizing treatment.To investigate the diagnosis and comprehensive treatment of esophageal leiomyoma. The clinical data of 77 cases of esophageal leiomyoma patients were analyzed between 2005 and 2013. Its diagnosis, treatment and prognosis were analyzed. 39 cases of patients were with eating choking feeling, 18 cases presented with chest pain and weight loss and 20 cases without any symptoms. Preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography of each patient was diagnosed as possibility of esophageal submucosal tumor. 3 All patients underwent tumor enucleation, in which tumor electrotomy under gastroscope were done for 2 cases, complete video-assisted thoracoscopic (CVATS) resection of tumor for 24 cases, thoracoscope assisted small incision tumor resection for 29 cases, conventional thoracic tumor resection for 22 cases. The comparison and the difference of complete video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group and the thoracoscope assisted small incision group for the operation time, bleeding volume, drainage volume, extubation time, hospitalization time and fasting time were not statistically significant (P < 0.05). All the patients recovered well and postoperative pathology of each patient was esophageal leiomyoma. They were followed up for 6 months to 8 years, average for 4 years, not recurrence of esophageal leiomyoma. Endoscopic ultrasonography is the most accurate method in diagnosis of esophageal leiomyoma. Esophageal leiomyoma which less than 1.0 cm in diameter, regular shape, originated in the muscularis mucosa, endoscopic electrotomy can be used as the preferred; Surgical operation is the main treatment of esophageal leiomyoma, three kinds of operation way has its own corresponding clinical indications, according to the clinical characteristics of patients and operator' habits to choose the corresponding operation way, all can achieve good treatment effect.Persistent neuropathic pain is associated with anxiety. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in pain-induced anxiety. Acupuncture is widely used for pain and anxiety. However, little is known about which acupuncture technique is optimal on pain-induced anxiety and the relationship between acupuncture effect and p-ERK. The rat model was induced by L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Male adult SD rats were randomly divided into control, SNL, strong manual acupuncture (sMA), mild manual acupuncture (mMA), and electroacupuncture (EA) group. Bilateral "Huantiao" (GB 30) were stimulated by sMA, mMA, and EA, respectively. The pain withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) and anxiety behavior were measured, and p-ERK protein expression and immunoreactivity cells in ACC were detected. PWTs increased significantly in both sMA and EA groups. Meanwhile, anxiety-like behavior was improved significantly in the sMA and mMA groups. Furthermore, the overexpression of p-ERK induced by SNL was downregulated by strong and mild manual acupuncture. Therefore, strong manual acupuncture on bilateral "Huantiao" (GB 30) could be a proper therapy relieving both pain and pain-induced anxiety. The effect of different acupuncture techniques on pain-induced anxiety may arise from the regulation of p-ERK in ACC.CONTEXT: Tetrahydro iso-Î± acids (THIAAs), derived from Humulus lupulus (hops), have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Undenatured type 2 collagen has been found to be effective in clinical studies in RA and osteoarthritis (OA). OBJECTIVE: The study intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a proprietary tablet containing 150 mg of n-enriched THIAA (nTHIAA) and 10 mg of undenatured type 2 collagen (UC-II) (containing 25% UC-II) in patients with arthritis. DESIGN: The study was an open-label case series. This article also includes a case history for 1 participant. SETTING: The study was conducted at the Functional Medicine Research Center (FMRC) in Gig Harbor, WA, USA, from February 2013-June 2013. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 17 adults, 12 women, and 5 men aged 39-69 y, who had chronic joint pain involving various joints, 13 with probable OA and 4 with possible RA. INTERVENTION: Participants took 2 tablets of nTHIAA + UC-II 2 Ã/d with meals for 12 wk. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed arthritis-related and quality-of-life questionnaires, at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12: (1) the visual analog scale for pain (VAS-P); (2) the medical symptoms questionnaire (MSQ), with the analysis particularly focusing on the joint/muscle subscale and total scores; (3) the health and wellness outcome questionnaire (MOS-SF36), with the analysis particularly focusing on the physical and mental subscales; (4) the arthritis impact questionnaire (AIQ), with the analysis particularly focusing on the arthritis symptoms and daily living subscales; (5) the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ-DI) with the analysis particularly focusing on question 26 (Q26), which indicates overall pain during the week prior to the survey; and (6) the arthritis impact measurement scales 2 (AIMS2). At 12 wk, participants also completed the visual analog scale for efficacy (VAS-E). RESULTS: All participants completed the 12-wk evaluation, and all reported improvements in pain. Significant improvements in scores on the questionnaires were observed as early as 2 wk. For example, the total score on the MSQ was significantly decreased from a mean of 20.76 Â± 2.90 (SE) at baseline to 12.24 Â± 2.81 after 2 wk (P < .001). At 12 wk, the participants rated the supplement's efficacy at 7.6 Â± 0.6 of 10. At baseline, 13 of the 17 participants were using analgesics for joint pain, compared with only 4 participants at 12 wk. Two of those 4 had reduced their analgesic dosages. The studied supplement was well tolerated, and no serious side effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The supplement containing nTHIAA and UC-II is safe and efficacious in participants with chronic joint pain.CONTEXT: Little is known about the effect of nutritional supplementation on metabolic optimization for enhancing adaptation and recovery of the connective tissue elements that support musculoskeletal function. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine the potential effect of supplementation with a novel, hydrolyzed chicken sternal cartilage extract-called BioCell Collagen-on biomarkers and functional indices of recovery from intense exercise. DESIGN: The research team designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study. SETTING: The study was conducted at the Center for Applied Health Sciences in Stow, OH, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 8 healthy, recreationally active individuals, with a mean age of 29.3 y. INTERVENTION: Participants ingested either 3 g of a novel, hydrolyzed chicken sternal cartilage extract called BioCell Collagen ("supplement") or 3 g of a placebo daily for 6 wk prior to challenge with an upper-body, muscle-damaging resistance exercise (UBC) on day 43 and a rechallenge on day 46 to assess functional recovery. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary endpoints were levels of 3 blood biomarkers-creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP)- and scores on a clinical pain scale and a perceived recovery scale (PRS). RESULTS: The extract attenuated the post-UBC increase in serum markers for muscle tissue damage: CK, LDH, and CRP. For the intervention group vs the placebo group, the mean changes were as follows: (1) an increase in CK of 20 U/L vs 4726 U/L, respectively; (2) a decrease in LDH of 3.5 U/L vs an increase of 82.9 U/L, respectively; and (3) an increase in CRP of 0.07 mg/L vs an increase of 0.7 mg/L, respectively. The performance decrement in bench press repetitions to failure was 57.9% on day 43 and 57.8% on day 46 for the intervention group vs 72.2% on day 43 and 65% on day 46 for the placebo group. The overall trend for the performance decrement, together with the results for the PRS, suggested that a more robust muscular recovery and adaptive response occurred with use of the extract. The supplement was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The study's preliminary data are promising with regard to the beneficial effects of the extract on connective tissue protection and recovery in those engaged in routine resistance training and cardiovascular exercise. A larger study is warranted to confirm and refine these findings.CONTEXT: Osteoarthritis, sometimes called degenerative joint disease, is the most common form of arthritis. It affects more than 20 million people in the United States, who mostly are older than age 45 y. No specific treatment exists to halt the progressive cartilage degeneration of osteoarthritis or to repair the damaged cartilage. Alternatives to pharmaceuticals include natural therapies and nutritional supplements. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the clinical response to daily supplementation with bioactive protein complex containing a collagen type 2 network, with associated growth factors, and osteoinductive proteins, known as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). DESIGN: The research team designed an open-label preliminary study. SETTING: Joint evaluations were self-administered by participants at their residences. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 44 individuals with self-reported osteoarthritis in the hip, knee, or ankle (ie, in weight-bearing joints). INTERVENTION: Participants self-administered orally a low-dose form of the ingredient (ie, 150 mg of Cyplexinol(Â®) Standard, once daily for 4 wk). OUTCOME MEASURES: Four parameters-pain intensity, frequency of pain, activity level, and strength-were evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS), both at baseline and at the end of the 4-wk period. RESULTS: Pain intensity decreased 45% on a 10-cm VAS from 2.85 cm (P = .0001; 95% CI, 2.54, 3.16) at baseline to 1.41 cm (P = .0001; 95% CI, 1.18, 1.64) at wk 4. Pain frequency decreased 55% from 3.16 cm (P = .0001; 95% CI, 2.88, 3.44) at baseline to 1.22 cm (P = .0001; 95% CI, 0.85, 1.59) at wk 4. Activity level increased from 1.58 cm (P = .0001; 95% CI, 1.34, 1.82) at baseline to 2.91 cm (P = .0001; 95% CI, 2.71, 3.11) at wk 4. Strength increased 80% from 1.24 cm (P = .0001; 95% CI, 0.91, 1.57) at baseline to 2.10 cm (P = .0001; 95% CI, 1.73, 2.47) at wk 4. CONCLUSIONS: The 44 participants reported subjective improvements in pain frequency and intensity as well as in activity level following administration of Cyplexinol(Â®). The results from this study identify the possible pathways associated with cartilage degradation, pain, and inflammation, which should be the focus of future research, and they suggest that the ingredient can be effective in helping to maintain joint homeostasis.BACKGROUND: Thus far, validated whole blood assays used in in vitro fibrinolysis experiments using thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are lacking or have yet to be tested in humans. The objective was first, to establish a standardized modified ROTEM approach to detect both hypo- and hyperfibrinolysis. And second, to perform a technical and clinical validation of the assay. METHODS: Blood was used of healthy volunteers, patients with sepsis, patients after cardiothoracic surgery, pregnant women, and cirrhotic liver disease patients. A whole blood tissue factor (TF) activated ROTEM assay with and without the addition of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) was developed. Plasma fibrinolysis determinants were measured in all volunteers and patients. RESULTS: Thirty five pM TF and additions of 125 and 175 ng/ml rTPA resulted in full lysis within 60 min in healthy volunteers. Coefficients of variation were below 10 % without and below 20 % with rTPA addition. In sepsis the hypofibrinolytic ROTEM profiles with 175 ng/ml rTPA were in line with the plasma determinants (high PAI-1, high fibrinogen, low tPA activity, and high d-dimers). After cardiothoracic surgery, reduced fibrinogen and platelet levels accounted for the reduced maximum clot firmness. The hypofibrinolytic profile is attributed to tranexamic acid use and elevated PAI-1 levels. The lowest rTPA concentration in cirrhosis resulted in hyperfibrinolysis in only few of the patients. In pregnancy normal profiles were found. DISCUSSION: Our high rTPA concentration demonstrates hypofibrinolytic profiles adequately in sepsis and after cardiothoracic surgery. Our low rTPA concentration of 125 ng/ml seems too high for demonstrating hyperfibrinolysis in cirrhotic liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to present a validated whole blood ROTEM approach to fibrinolysis testing using added rTPA, which can be of added value next to classical plasma based fibrinolysis assays.This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical treatment with natural herbal medicines on recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Nine electronic databases were searched to identify the randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials that reported the potential effect of natural herbal medicines on RAS published in Chinese or English. Ulcer size and duration, and remission of pain were assessed as main outcome measures. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Handbook for Systemic Review of Interventions and Rev Man software. Thirteen trials with a total of 1,515 patients were included in the present analysis, which showed that topical treatment with natural herbal medicines seemed to benefit RAS patients by reducing ulcer size, shortening ulcer duration, and relieving pain without severe side effects. In conclusion, there is some evidence of the efficacy of topically applied natural herbal medicines with regards to improved RAS outcome measures and fewer side effects. However, given the limitations of this study, the evidence remains insufficient. Well-designed and high-quality randomized controlled trials are required for further exploration.Active involvement of anesthesiologists in perioperative management is important to ensure the patients' safety. This study aimed to investigate the state of anesthetic services in Korea by identifying anesthetic service providers. From the insurance claims data of National Health Insurance for 3 yr, the Korean state of anesthetic services was analyzed. The claims for anesthesia from the medical institutions which hire their own anesthesiologist or with an anesthesiologist invitation fee are assumed to be the anesthesia performed by anesthesiologists. The annual anesthetic data were similar during the study period. In 2013, total counts of 2,129,871 were composed with general anesthesia (55%), regional anesthesia (36%) and procedural sedation with intravenous anesthetics (9%). About 80% of total cases of general anesthesia were performed in general hospitals, while more than 60% of the regional anesthesia and sedation were performed in the clinics and hospitals under 100 beds. Non-anesthesiologists performed 273,006 cases of anesthesia (13% of total) including 36,008 of general anesthesia, 143,134 of regional anesthesia, and 93,864 of sedation, mainly in the clinics and hospitals under 100 beds. All procedural sedations in the institutions without direct employed anesthesiologist were performed by non-anesthesiologists. Significant numbers of anesthesia are performed by non-anesthesiologist in Korea. To promote anesthetic services that prioritize the safety of patients, the standard to qualify anesthetic service is required. Surgeons and patients need to enhance their perception of anesthesia, and the payment system should be revised in a way that advocates anesthesiologist-performed anesthetic services.Transurethral resection has been the gold standard in the operative management of benign prostatic hyperplasia and bladder tumor; however, it is associated with several complications that may cause patient discomfort. We evaluated the usefulness of continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine on emergence agitation, hemodynamic status, and recovery profiles in patients undergoing elective surgery by a randomized clinical trial. Sixty patients aged 30 to 80 yr who were scheduled for elective transurethral resection under general anesthesia were included in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups (control group, group C; dexmedetomidine group, group D). A total of 60 male patients were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to group C (n=30) or group D (n=30). The quality of emergence in group D was marked by a significantly lower incidence of emergence agitation than in group C (P=0.015). Patients in group D therefore felt less discomfort induced by the indwelling Foley catheter than those in group C (P=0.022). No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to side effects including bradycardia (P=0.085), hypotension (P=0.640), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (P=0.389). Our study showed that intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion effectively reduced the incidence and intensity of emergence agitation and catheter-induced bladder discomfort without delaying recovery time and discharge time, thus providing smooth emergence during the recovery period in patients undergoing transurethral resection (Clinical Trial Registry No. KT0001683).The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is a highly vulnerable site in diabetic neuropathy. Under diabetic conditions, the DRG experiences tissue ischemia or lower ambient oxygen tension that leads to aberrant metabolic functions. Metabolic dysfunctions have been documented to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diverse pain hypersensitivities. However, the contribution of diabetes-induced metabolic dysfunctions in the DRG to the pathogenesis of painful diabetic neuropathy remains ill-explored. In this study, we report that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK2 and PDK4), key regulatory enzymes in glucose metabolism, mediate glycolytic metabolic shift in the DRG leading to painful diabetic neuropathy. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes substantially enhanced the expression and activity of the PDKs in the DRG, and the genetic ablation of Pdk2 and Pdk4 attenuated the hyperglycemia-induced pain hypersensitivity. Mechanistically, Pdk2/4 deficiency inhibited the diabetes-induced lactate surge, expression of pain-related ion channels, activation of satellite glial cells, and infiltration of macrophages in the DRG, in addition to reducing central sensitization and neuroinflammation hallmarks in the spinal cord, which likely accounts for the attenuated pain hypersensitivity. Pdk2/4-deficient mice were partly resistant to the diabetes-induced loss of peripheral nerve structure and function. Furthermore, in the experiments using DRG neuron cultures, lactic acid treatment enhanced the expression of the ion channels and compromised cell viability. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of DRG PDKs or lactic acid production substantially attenuated diabetes-induced pain hypersensitivity. Taken together, PDK2/4 induction and the subsequent lactate surge induce the metabolic shift in the diabetic DRG, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of painful diabetic neuropathy.The endogenous lipid amides, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), exert marked anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects in animal models by engaging nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î±. PEA and OEA are produced by macrophages and other host-defense cells and are deactivated by the lysosomal cysteine amidase, N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), which is highly expressed in macrophages and B-lymphocytes. In the present study, we examined whether (a) NAAA might be involved in the inflammatory reaction triggered by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the rat paw; and (b) administration of 4-cyclohexylbutyl-N-[(S)-2-oxoazetidin-3-yl]-carbamate (ARN726), a novel systemically active NAAA inhibitor, attenuates such reaction. Injection of CFA into the paw produced local edema and heat hyperalgesia, which were accompanied by decreased PEA and OEA content (assessed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) and increased NAAA levels (assessed by western blot and ex vivo enzyme activity measurements) in paw tissue. Administration of undec-10-ynyl-N-[(3S)-2-oxoazetidin-3-yl carbamate (ARN14686), a NAAA-preferring activity-based probe, revealed that NAAA was catalytically active in CFA-treated paws. Administration of ARN726 reduced NAAA activity and restored PEA and OEA levels in inflamed tissues, and significantly decreased CFA-induced inflammatory symptoms, including pus production and myeloperoxidase activity. The results confirm the usefulness of ARN726 as a probe to investigate the functions of NAAA in health and disease, and suggest that this enzyme may provide a new molecular target for the treatment of arthritis.BACKGROUND: Occupying new, active design office buildings designed for health promotion and connectivity provides an opportunity to evaluate indoor environment effects on healthy behaviour, sedentariness and workplace perceptions. AIMS: To determine if moving to a health-promoting building changed workplace physical activity, sedentary behaviour, workplace perceptions and productivity. METHODS: Participants from four locations at the University of Sydney, Australia, relocated into a new active design building. After consent, participants completed an online questionnaire 2 months before moving and 2 months after. Questions related to health behaviours (physical activity and sitting time), musculoskeletal issues, perceptions of the office environment, productivity and engagement. RESULTS: There were 34 participants (60% aged 25-45, 78% female, 84% employed full-time); 21 participants provided complete data. Results showed that after the move participants spent less work time sitting (83-70%; P < 0.01) and more time standing (9-21%; P < 0.01), while walking time remained unchanged. Participants reported less low back pain (P < 0.01). Sixty per cent of participants in the new workplace were in an open-plan office, compared to 16% before moving. Participants perceived the new work environment as more stimulating, better lit and ventilated, but noisier and providing less storage. No difference was reported in daily physical activity, number of stairs climbed or productivity. CONCLUSIONS: Moving to an active design building appeared to have physical health-promoting effects on workers, but workers' perceptions about the new work environment varied. These results will inform future studies in other new buildings.Until recently there have been few primary care office-based strategies to reduce the transmission of HIV. In May 2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published updated practice guidelines recommending the use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily oral dosing of tenofovir/emtricitabine to help prevent HIV infection in high-risk individuals (strength of recommendation, A). Knowledge of PrEP among primary care providers is low, however, and this intervention is likely reaching only a small fraction of eligible patients. PrEP is recommended for certain injection drug users, nonmonogamous men who have sex with men, heterosexual women who have sex with men who have sex with men or injection drug users, and those in HIV serodiscordant relationships. Providers should obtain baseline laboratory values and provide initial counseling before prescribing PrEP. Regular office visits are necessary to ensure adherence, provide ongoing counseling, and monitor for side effects, including nausea, abdominal pain, headache, and, less commonly, increased creatinine. Guidelines and toolkits have been developed to assist in incorporating PrEP into primary care practice. PrEP is gaining widespread acceptance and has become a crucial tool in the fight to stop the spread of HIV.Osteoporosis, a debilitating disease caused by an imbalance between the action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, is becoming an increasing problem in today's aging population. Although many advances in this field have addressed certain aspects of disease progression and pain management, new approaches to treatment are required. This review focuses on the influence of tryptophan, its metabolites and their influence on bone remodeling. Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, melatonin, kynurenines and niacin. Changes of tryptophan levels were noticed in bone metabolic diseases. Moreover, some works indicate that tryptophan plays a role in osteoblastic differentiation. Serotonin can exert different effects on bones, which depend on site of serotonin synthesis. Gut-derived serotonin inhibits bone formation, whereas brain-derived serotonin enhances bone formation and decreases bone resorption. Melatonin, increased differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into the osteoblastic cell lineage. Results of melatonin action on bone are anabolic and antiresorptive. Activation of the second tryptophan metabolic pathway, the kynurenine pathway, is associated with osteoblastogenesis and can be implicated in the occurrence of bone diseases. Oxidation products like kynurenine stopped proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. This may result in inhibition of osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation. Kynurenic acid acts as an antagonist at glutamate receptors, which are expressed on osteoclasts. Quinolinic acid activates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid exhibits pro-oxidant and antioxidant activity. Decreased concentration of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid can be one of the causes of osteoporosis. 3-hydroxykynurenine reduced the viability of osteoblast-like cells. Picolinic acid exerted osteogenic effect in vitro. Kynurenine derivatives exert various effects on bones. Discovery of the exact mechanism of action of tryptophan metabolites on bones may take us a step closer to understanding the complicated mechanism of bone metabolism, which in turn may result in finding a new, effective therapy for treating bone diseases.CONTEXT: 'Depression, fatigue, pain' (DFP) and 'depression, insomnia, pain' (DIP) symptom clusters (SCs) have been proposed in cancer. These symptoms are common and co-occur, that is, they constitute clusters of patients rather than symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The following research questions were addressed: (1) What is the frequency of co-occurrence of two symptom groups (DFP and DIP) in advanced cancer? (2) What is the degree of symptom item association within each symptom group? (3) Were either of these symptom trios associated with prognosis? METHODS: We reanalysed a symptom data set of 1000 patients with advanced cancer. We identified the frequency of co-occurrence of two symptom groups: DFP and DIP, using both prevalence and severity data. The symptom associations were tested by Ï(2) and Spearman correlations. We also determined whether either of these symptom trios were associated with a major biological outcome, that is, survival by time-to-event analyses. RESULTS: (1) Although DFP and DIP co-occured in about a quarter of the population, they were not SCs, but rather patient clusters. (2) Many persons had only one symptom from any symptom pair, and correlation coefficients were low for all symptom pairs. (3) Neither DFP nor DIP were associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Neither DFP nor DIP symptom item combinations constituted a specific cancer SC contrary to prior reports. DFP co-occurred in 27% and DIP in only 20%. Additionally, these symptom combinations were not associated with a biological outcome, that is, poor prognosis. Patient subgroups identified by shared symptom experiences alone do not identify SCs.OBJECTIVES: To conduct the first systematic review from an epidemiological perspective regarding the association between high-heeled shoe wear and hallux valgus, musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis (OA) and both first-party and second-party injury in human participants without prior musculoskeletal conditions. SETTING: A systematic review of international peer-reviewed scientific literature across seven major languages. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted on seven major bibliographic databases in July 2015 to initially identify all scholarly articles on high-heeled shoes. Supplementary manual searches were conducted. Titles, abstracts and full-text articles were sequentially screened to identify all articles assessing epidemiological evidence regarding the association between high-heeled shoe wear and hallux valgus, musculoskeletal pain, OA and both first-party and second-party injury in human participants without prior musculoskeletal conditions. Standardised data extraction and quality assessment (Threats to Validity tool) were conducted. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Musculoskeletal pain or OA as assessed by clinical diagnosis or clinical assessment tool. First-party or second-party injury. RESULTS: 644 unique records were identified, 56 full-text articles were screened and 18 studies included in the review. Four studies assessed the relationship with hallux valgus and three found a significant association. Two studies assessed the association with OA and neither found a significant association. Five studies assessed the association with musculoskeletal pain and three found a significant association. Eight studies assessed first-party injury and seven found evidence of a significant injury toll associated with high-heeled shoes. One study provided data on second-party injury and the injury toll was low. CONCLUSIONS: High-heeled shoes were shown to be associated with hallux valgus, musculoskeletal pain and first-party injury. No conclusive evidence regarding OA and second-party injury was found. Societal and clinical relevance of these findings is discussed. Concern is expressed about the expectation to wear high-heeled shoes in some work and social situations and access by children.INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the most common type of sleep-disordered breathing, is associated with significant immediate and long-term morbidity, including fragmented sleep and impaired daytime functioning, as well as more severe consequences, such as hypertension, impaired cognitive function and reduced quality of life. Perioperatively, OSA occurs frequently as a consequence of pre-existing vulnerability, surgery and drug effects. The impact of OSA on postoperative respiratory complications (PRCs) needs to be better characterised. As OSA is associated with significant comorbidities, such as obesity, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke, it is unclear whether OSA or its comorbidities are the mechanism of PRCs. This project aims to (1) develop a novel prediction score identifying surgical patients at high risk of OSA, (2) evaluate the association of OSA risk on PRCs and (3) evaluate if pharmacological agents used during surgery modify this association. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using hospital-based electronic patient data and perioperative data on medications administered and vital signs. We will use data from Partners Healthcare clinical databases, Boston, Massachusetts. First, a prediction model for OSA will be developed using OSA diagnostic codes and polysomnography procedural codes as the reference standard, and will be validated by medical record review. Results of the prediction model will be used to classify patients in the database as high, medium or low risk of OSA, and we will investigate the effect of OSA on risk of PRCs. Finally, we will test whether the effect of OSA on PRCs is modified by the use of intraoperative pharmacological agents known to increase upper airway instability, including neuromuscular blockade, neostigmine, opioids, anaesthetics and sedatives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Partners Human Research Committee approved this study (protocol number: 2014P000218). Study results will be made available in the form of manuscripts for publication and presentations at national and international meetings.PURPOSE: Evaluation of the efficacy of the FalenaÂ® and Aperiusâ¢ PerCLIDâ¢ interspinous devices in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic intermittent claudication refractory to conservative treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 24 patients (20 male and 4 female patients; 61âÂ±â7 years old), treated with an implantation of the AperiusTM PerCLIDâ¢ system, and from 35 patients (29 male and 6 female patients; 65âÂ±â9 years old) treated with the FalenaÂ® interspinous device.Patient pain intensity was evaluated by a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS), with a score (ranging from 0â=âno pain to 10â=âunbearable pain) that was collected before the procedure, at baseline; and at months 1, 6 and 12 after the interventional procedure. The assessment of quality of life (QOL) impairment was evaluated by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire, which was administered beforehand at baseline; and at months 1, 6 and 12 after the interventional procedure. The vertebral canal area was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans before the treatment and at the one-year follow-up. RESULTS: All patients completed the study with no complications. Both the Falena group and Aperius group of surgery patients showed a statistically significant reduction of their VAS and ODI scores at the 6- and 12-month follow-up (pâ<â0.0001). A statistically significant increase in the vertebral canal area was observed both in the group that received Falena (pâ<â0.0001) and in the group that received Aperius (pâ=â0.0003). At the 1-year follow-up, we observed that there was a higher increase of vertebral canal area in those patients whom were treated with the Falena device (pâ<â0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The implantation of FalenaÂ® and Aperiusâ¢ PerCLIDâ¢ interspinous devices is an effective and safe procedure, in the medium term.AIM: Anagnostou etÂ al. investigated the efficacy of oral immunotherapy (OIT) in treating peanut allergy. SETTING AND DESIGN: An unmasked randomized controlled crossover trial of 7-16Â year olds with double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC)-proven peanut allergy. The first phase compared an active group undergoing 26Â weeks of OIT with daily ingestion of peanut protein vs. a control group avoiding peanuts. Both groups underwent DBPCFC to peanut at 26Â weeks. In the second phase the control group was then offered OIT for 26Â weeks. STUDY EXPOSURE: Participants undergoing OIT attended hospital every 2Â weeks to initiate and increase their daily peanut protein dose through nine stages (2, 5, 12Â·5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800Â mg - about five peanuts), subsequently maintaining consumption at the highest tolerated dose. Primary outcome The primary outcome compared the proportions of active- and control-group participants able to ingest a cumulative dose of 1400Â mg of peanut protein (about 10 peanuts) during their DBPCFC at the end of the first phase without reacting. Secondary outcomes Further outcomes included the proportion of participants who tolerated the top maintenance dosage of 800Â mg protein up to 26Â weeks; the proportion of the control group who were desensitized or tolerated daily ingestion of 800Â mg protein in the second phase; threshold changes in no observed adverse effect level after OIT (NOAEL: defined as the highest dose of peanut protein tolerated in milligrams of protein during challenge or immunotherapy); change in quality of life; number and type of adverse events; and immunological parameters (basophil reactivity, peanut-specific IgE, total IgE and skin-prick test). RESULTS: Primary outcome Twenty-four of 39 (62%) of the active group were able to tolerate the 1400Â mg of peanut protein during their DBPCFC after 26Â weeks of OIT, compared with none of the 46 control participants (PÂ <Â 0Â·001). Secondary outcomes Twenty-five of 46 (54%) of the control group had a negative 1400-mg peanut protein challenge at the end of phase 2. Combining the two groups, 49 ofÂ 85 children (58%) were desensitized. Thirty-three of 39 (85%) active participants in phase one and 42 of 46 (91%) control participants in phase two tolerated 800Â mg of OIT daily - a combined result of 75 of 85 (88%) trial participants. The median absolute change in NOAEL between baseline and 26Â weeks was 1345Â mg (PÂ =Â 0Â·002), or a 25Â·5-fold increase (PÂ <Â 0Â·001) for the active group. Both the active and control groups demonstrated a significant improvement (decrease) in Food Allergy Quality of Life scores after OIT in the under-13-year-old participants: -1Â·61 and -1Â·41, respectively (both PÂ <Â 0Â·001). Mild side-effects predominated, with 54 (57%) reporting abdominal pain and 31 (33%) reporting vomiting. However, 21 (22%) also reported wheezing and one (1%) laryngeal oedema. One participant received adrenaline by self-administration on two occasions for wheezing. CONCLUSIONS: Anagnostou etÂ al. concluded that OIT successfully induced desensitization in challenge-proven peanut-allergic children and resulted in a clinically and socially meaningful increase in tolerated peanut protein. Quality of life improved after intervention and there was a good safety profile.The aim of this study was to investigate patients' previous knowledge, satisfaction and experience regarding a ((18)F)-fluoride positron emission tomography / computed tomography examination (((18)F)-fluoride PET/CT) and to explore whether experienced discomfort during the examination or pain was associated with reduced image quality. A further aim was to explore whether patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was associated with their satisfaction and experiences of the examination.METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with a histopathological diagnosis of prostate cancer who were scheduled for ((18)F)-fluoride PET/CT were asked to participate in the study, which was performed between November 2011 and April 2013. A questionnaire was used to collect information regarding the patients' previous knowledge and experience of the examination. Image quality assessment was performed according to an arbitrary scale. The EORTC-QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 were used to assess HRQoL. RESULTS: Forty-six patients (96%) completed the questionnaires. Twenty-six per cent of participants did not know at all what a ((18)F)-fluoride PET/CT examination was. The majority (52-70%) were to a very high degree satisfied with the care provided by the nursing staff but less satisfied with the information given prior to the examination. The image quality was similar in patients who were exhausted or claustrophobic during the examination and those who were not. No correlations between HRQoL and the participants' experience of ((18)F)-fluoride PET/CT were found. CONCLUSION: The majority of participants were satisfied with the care provided by the nursing staff, but there is still room for improvement especially regarding the information prior to the examination. Long examination time may be strenuous, for the patient but there was no difference in image quality between patients who felt discomfort during the examination or pain and those who did not.OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of cardiac CT compared with exercise stress testing (EST) in improving the health-related quality of life of patients with stable chest pain. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis alongside a single-centre randomised controlled trial carried out in Northern Ireland. Patients with stable chest pain were randomised to undergo either cardiac CT assessment or EST (standard care). The main outcome measure was cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained at 1âyear. RESULTS: Of the 500 patients recruited, 250 were randomised to cardiac CT and 250 were randomised to EST. Cardiac CT was the dominant strategy as it was both less costly (incremental total costs -Â£50.45; 95% CI -Â£672.26 to Â£571.36) and more effective (incremental QALYs 0.02; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05) than EST. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of Â£20â000 per QALY the probability of cardiac CT being cost-effective was 83%. Subgroup analyses indicated that cardiac CT appears to be most cost-effective in patients with a likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) of <30%, followed by 30%-60% and then >60%. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac CT is cost-effective compared with EST and cost-effectiveness was observed to vary with likelihood of CAD. This finding could have major implications for how patients with chest pain in the UK are assessed, however it would need to be validated in other healthcare systems.

The aim of this paper is to present a case of this rare tumour and review the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of this disease. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 22-year-old female diagnosed with multicystic mesothelioma after an urgent resection of intra-abdominal tumour in the context of acute abdominal pain. In the subsequent follow-up, the patient had a recurrence of the lesion, and at 2 years was treated by further resection. CONCLUSIONS: Benign multicystic mesothelioma is a benign tumour of unknown origin, and with a non-specific clinical manifestation. The most effective treatment is surgical, although there is a high tendency to local recurrence.BACKGROUND: Duodenal carcinoma is very rare. It represents 33-45% of the all tumours of the small bowel. The symptoms are non-specific, and the diagnosis is often accidental. CLINICAL CASE: A 35-year old man was admitted to our hospital with post-prandial abdominal pain. Upper gastrointestinal examination revealed a tumour of the third duodenal portion, which was diagnosed, using endoscopic biopsy, as a tubular adenoma with high grade dysplasia. The computed axial tomography scan, the magnetic resonance imaging, and the endoscopic ultrasound showed the neoplasia of the third duodenal portion with no lymph node or peritoneal metastases. Partial resection of the duodenum was performed. The definitive histopathological diagnosis was primary adenocarcinoma of the third duodenal portion. pT2 N0M0, originated in a tubular adenoma. CONCLUSIONS: Primitive neoplasia of the duodenum is very rare. Duodeno-cephalo-pancreatectomy is recommended in proximally located tumours, while segmental resection of the duodenum is appropriated for distal locations, with the same survival.
