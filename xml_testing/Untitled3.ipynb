The aim of this study was to investigate the role of cell surface TNFR1 in TRAPS, and the contribution of TNF-dependent and TNF-independent mechanisms to the production of cytokines. HEK-293 and SK-HEP-1 cell lines were stably transfected with WT or TRAPS-associated variants of human TNF receptor superfamily 1A gene.

In HEK-293 cells transfected with death domain-inactivated (R347A) TNFR1, and in SK-HEP-1 cells transfected with normal (full-length) TNFR1, cytokine production stimulated in the absence of exogenous TNF by the presence of certain TNFR1 variants was not inhibited by the anti-TNFR1 dAb. In SK-Hep-1 cells, specific TRAPS mutations increased the level of cytokine response to TNF, compared to WT, and this augmented cytokine production was suppressed by the anti-TNFR1 dAb.

Expression of NK1R and SP in T cells was upregulated by IL-23 but a trend was observed with IL-12. The IL-23 effect likely involves IL-17 production that additionally mediates IL-23 effects. Mutual interactions exist with SP enhancing the cytokines IL-23 and IL-12, and SP and NK1R expression being differentially but potentially synergistically regulated by these cytokines. These findings suggest a proinflammatory role for SP in autoimmune inflammation. We propose a model whereby immunocyte derived SP stimulates Th1 and Th17 autoreactive cells migrating to the central nervous system (CNS), enhances their crossing the blood brain barrier and perpetuates inflammation in the CNS by being released from damaged nerves and activating both resident glia and infiltrating immune cells.

Our aim was to understand the extent of signaling pathway perturbation in TRAPS.

In C33Y-TNFR1-expressing SK-Hep-1 cells and TRAPS patients' PBMCs, a subtle, constitutive upregulation of a wide spectrum of signaling intermediates and their phosphorylated forms was observed; these were associated with a proinflammatory/antiapoptotic phenotype. In TRAPS patients' PBMCs, this upregulation of proinflammatory signaling pathways was observed irrespective of concurrent treatment with glucocorticoids, anakinra or etanercept, and the absence of overt clinical symptoms at the time that the blood samples were taken.

Conversely a new generation of Component Resolved Diagnostic systems using pure proteins is highly specific and totally dependent on the availability of the protein in its recombinant or natural origin form. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a microarray test based on protein extracts of food components. Our approach relies on innovations on three different fronts: the novelty of using arrayed food samples sequentially extracted with detergent and chaotropic agents, the ability to measure four different Ig classes simultaneously and the ability to analyse the generated data via a suitable bioinformatics/statistical analysis interface. This approach combines high numerical power of microarrays with automation, high throughput analysis and enables detailed investigation of the Ig profiles to food antigens. The prototype shown contains extracts of approximately 350 food ingredients that cover most of the food products found in the UK. Here we showed that the use of a sequential extraction technique to solubilise and then denature food samples has its benefits in the assessment of variations in antigenicity when tested with human sera. A patient dependent degree of class specificity was observed with human sera (IgG specificity correlates well with IgA>IgM>IgE). Besides generating a simultaneous profile for IgA, IgM, IgG and IgE the array system has shown good discrimination between challenge responders in atopic and non-atopic individuals. Poly- and mono-specific IgE responders were easily identified. The mathematical modelling of specific IgE content showed good correlations when compared with established IgE antibody testing assay (UniCAP). Although in its proof-of-principle stages, the immune profiling technique described here has the potential to provide unique insights into exposure/sensitization and establish relationships between specific immunoglobulin classes and subclasses against food protein antigens.

Immuno-precipitation was therefore investigated as a means of measuring interactions between antibodies and phage clones selected from random peptide display libraries.

In order to detect and quantitate the phage that had formed immune complexes and been precipitated, advantage was taken of the biological properties of the phage by inducing infection of Escherichia coli by the precipitated phage. The aim was to quantitate the phage precipitated by determining the number of plaques produced, which would therefore be proportional to the degree of interaction between the phage and the antibody in solution.

Conversely a new generation of Component Resolved Diagnostic systems using pure proteins is highly specific and totally dependent on the availability of the protein in its recombinant or natural origin form. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a microarray test based on protein extracts of food components. Our approach relies on innovations on three different fronts: the novelty of using arrayed food samples sequentially extracted with detergent and chaotropic agents, the ability to measure four different Ig classes simultaneously and the ability to analyse the generated data via a suitable bioinformatics/statistical analysis interface. This approach combines high numerical power of microarrays with automation, high throughput analysis and enables detailed investigation of the Ig profiles to food antigens. The prototype shown contains extracts of approximately 350 food ingredients that cover most of the food products found in the UK. Here we showed that the use of a sequential extraction technique to solubilise and then denature food samples has its benefits in the assessment of variations in antigenicity when tested with human sera. A patient dependent degree of class specificity was observed with human sera (IgG specificity correlates well with IgA>IgM>IgE). Besides generating a simultaneous profile for IgA, IgM, IgG and IgE the array system has shown good discrimination between challenge responders in atopic and non-atopic individuals.

Three mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for glutamic acid decarboxylase were used to select peptides as 9-mers on T7 phage, linear 12-mers on pIII of M13 phage, or constrained 15-mers on pVIII of M13 phage. Following the cloning and sequencing of selected phage, mixtures of antibody and phage were incubated in solution and the immune complexes were precipitated with Protein G bound to Sepharose beads. In order to detect and quantitate the phage that had formed immune complexes and been precipitated, advantage was taken of the biological properties of the phage by inducing infection of Escherichia coli by the precipitated phage. The aim was to quantitate the phage precipitated by determining the number of plaques produced, which would therefore be proportional to the degree of interaction between the phage and the antibody in solution. The results presented here indicate that this method of measuring monoclonal antibody interactions with phage selected for expression of peptides recognised by the monoclonal antibody is highly specific and sensitive.')\n",

We investigated the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta isoforms by isolated and cultured primary human intestinal myofibroblasts and the responsiveness of these cells and intestinal epithelial cells to TGF-beta isoforms. Normal intestinal myofibroblasts released predominantly TGF-beta(3) and ulcerative colitis myofibroblasts expressed both TGF-beta(1) and TGF-beta(3), whereas in myofibroblast cultures from fibrotic Crohn's disease tissue, there was significantly lower expression of TGF-beta(3) but enhanced release of TGF-beta(2). These distinctive patterns of TGF-beta isoform release were sustained through several myofibroblast passages. Proliferation of Crohn's disease myofibroblasts was significantly greater than that of myofibroblasts derived from normal and ulcerative colitis tissue. In contrast to cells from normal and ulcerative colitis tissue, neutralization of the three TGF-beta isoforms did not affect the proliferation of Crohn's disease intestinal myofibroblasts. Studies on the effect of recombinant TGF-beta isoforms on epithelial restitution and proliferation suggest that TGF-beta(2) may be the least effective of the three isoforms in intestinal wound repair. In conclusion, the enhanced release of TGF-beta(2) but reduced expression of TGF-beta(3) by Crohn's disease intestinal myofibroblasts, together with their enhanced proliferative capacity, may lead to the development of intestinal strictures.\")\n",
      "('AbstractText', 'We report here the molecular characterisation of the Arabidopsis MALE STERILITY1 gene, which is a critical sporophytic controlling factor for anther and pollen development. Homozygous ms1 mutants do not produce viable pollen, but are otherwise phenotypically normal. Degeneration of pollen occurs soon after microspore release from the tetrads, at which time the tapetum also appears abnormally vacuolated. The MS1 gene is expressed at low levels in anthers from closed buds, with expression in the tapetum at the stage of microspore release. No expression is seen in open flowers. The deduced MS1 protein sequence shows strong homology to the PHD-finger motif found in known transcription factors from humans, yeast and higher plants. Six alleles of ms1 have been identified; all result in premature termination of the MS1 protein and loss of the PHD-finger motif. MS1 is likely to play a key role in regulating transcription during specific stages of male gametogenesis and anther development. As such, MS1 provides a valuable tool for the manipulation of male sterility in higher plants.')\n",

To address this further, we examined in detail the IHL from HCV-infected patients and controls, focusing on the antigen-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte component. Individual T cells from needle liver biopsies and peripheral blood were isolated from patients with chronic HCV infection and examined directly ex vivo. We used RT-PCR spectratyping to compare the breadth of the T cell receptor usage in the liver in comparison with the peripheral blood, and applied MHC class I tetramer technology to investigate the numbers of HCV-specific CD8(+) cells in the two compartments. T cell receptor usage in the liver of HCV-infected patients was broad, comparable with that in the peripheral blood of the same patients. A much higher proportion of liver CD8(+) cells expressed receptors specific for HCV antigens compared with paired peripheral blood CD8(+) cells. A greater proportion of the liver tetramer-positive cells expressed the activation marker CD69, compared with those in the periphery or other CD8(+) cells in the liver. In the course of chronic HCV infection, HCV-specific CD8 cells, which have been recently activated, appear to accumulate specifically in the livers of infected patients but are present in much lower numbers in the peripheral circulation.

Quantitative RT-PCR was used to investigate TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3 mRNA levels in nine specimens of normal cervix and 15 cervical precancers (eight HPV-positive, including five HPV 16-positive). Immunocytochemical expression of TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3 was examined in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) positive for HPV 16 (26), and in HPV-negative, normal ectocervical epithelium (9); reserve cell hyperplasia (12); and immature (7) and mature (15) squamous metaplasia. The intensity of staining for TGF-beta1 was measured using grey-scale image analysis. Microdissection was used to investigate epithelial and stromal (excluding crypts) levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA in HPV 16-positive cervical precancer. Normal cervix, including reserve cells and immature and mature metaplasia, showed strong immunocytochemical expression of all TGF-beta isoforms. Expression was decreased in the basal third of the epithelium in CIN 1, in the basal and middle thirds in CIN 2, and in all layers in CIN 3. Quantitative analysis of TGF-beta1 expression showed that the changes in CIN compared with normal ectocervix and mature metaplasia were statistically highly significant (p<0.001, ANOVA).

However, most effort has been directed towards capillary blood glucose monitoring techniques. The most common biochemical near-patient testing device is the dry reagent strip or 'dipstick' for urinalysis. This report describes a quality assurance programme for urinalysis, used in the wards and clinics of a district general hospital, and in some of the general practitioner surgeries within its catchment area. The project describes the preparation of an aqueous 'urine' sample, the design of a report form, the dispatch of the sample and report forms to the ward/clinic/health centre, the receipt and scoring of the returned results, and the assessment of the results, both in terms of management information and sources of error. Samples were spiked to give a target value midway between two colour blocks for each analyte. Results were scored as +/- 1 if adjacent colour block to the target, +/- 2 for results two colour blocks (error) and +/- 3 (gross error) for results three or more colour blocks from the target value. For urine glucose, results showed an overall 14.7% error and 2.6% gross error rate. Similar scoring gave the following error and gross error rates for the other analytes: bilirubin (1.0%, 3.3%); ketone (4.3%, 0.3%); specific gravity (13.4%, 3.1%); pH (11.2%, 6.5%); blood (7.7%, 2.9%); protein (9.7%, 2.3%); and nitrite (gross errors 4.9%). Investigation of the results of the programme showed four types of error in dipstick testing-timing, misalignment, misunderstanding and transcription. Analysis of the results showed a reduction in error rates when an electronic reader was used (errors 2.0%, gross errors 0.75%), compared to reading against the colour blocks on the side of the bottle (7.7%, 1.6%) or using the colour blocks on a flat card reader (7.4%, 1.7%). The report demonstrates the importance of a QA scheme in providing a reliable screening service. It gives confidence to the users of dipsticks, information on training needs to clinical managers, and an understanding of both types of error and how they can be reduced.\")\n",

Conversely a new generation of Component Resolved Diagnostic systems using pure proteins is highly specific and totally dependent on the availability of the protein in its recombinant or natural origin form. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a microarray test based on protein extracts of food components. Our approach relies on innovations on three different fronts: the novelty of using arrayed food samples sequentially extracted with detergent and chaotropic agents, the ability to measure four different Ig classes simultaneously and the ability to analyse the generated data via a suitable bioinformatics/statistical analysis interface. This approach combines high numerical power of microarrays with automation, high throughput analysis and enables detailed investigation of the Ig profiles to food antigens. The prototype shown contains extracts of approximately 350 food ingredients that cover most of the food products found in the UK. Here we showed that the use of a sequential extraction technique to solubilise and then denature food samples has its benefits in the assessment of variations in antigenicity when tested with human sera. A patient dependent degree of class specificity was observed with human sera (IgG specificity correlates well with IgA>IgM>IgE). Besides generating a simultaneous profile for IgA, IgM, IgG and IgE the array system has shown good discrimination between challenge responders in atopic and non-atopic individuals. Poly- and mono-specific IgE responders were easily identified. The mathematical modelling of specific IgE content showed good correlations when compared with established IgE antibody testing assay (UniCAP).

These results support and extend our previous observation that astrocytes and microglia produce IL-12/IL-23p40. Moreover, we show that stimulated astrocytes and microglia produce biologically active IL-12p70. Because IL-12 and IL-23 share p40, we wanted to determine whether astrocytes also express IL-12p35 and IL-23p19, as microglia were already shown to express them. Astrocytes expressed IL-12p35 mRNA constitutively, and IL-23 p19 after stimulation. Thus, astrocytes, under inflammatory conditions, express all subunits of IL-12/IL-23. Their ability to present antigen to encephalitogenic T cells can be blocked by neutralizing anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibodies.')\n",

IA-2 responsive T cells recognize determinants within regions represented by amino acids 787-817 and 841-869 of the molecule. Epitopes for IA-2 autoantibodies are largely conformational and not well defined. In this study, we used peptide phage display and homology modeling to characterize the epitope of a monoclonal IA-2 Ab (96/3) from a human type 1 diabetic patient. This Ab competes for IA-2 binding with Abs from the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes and therefore binds a region close to common autoantibody epitopes. Alignment of peptides obtained after screening phage-displayed peptide libraries with purified 96/3 identified a consensus binding sequence of Asn-x-Glu-x-x-(aromatic)-x-x-Gly. The predicted surface on a three-dimensional homology model of the tyrosine phosphatase domain of IA-2 was analyzed for clusters of Asn, Glu, and aromatic residues and amino acids contributing to the epitope investigated using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of each of amino acids Asn(858), Glu(836), and Trp(799) reduced 96/3 Ab binding by >45%.

      "('AbstractText', 'Libraries of random peptides displayed by bacteriophage can be screened to select phage expressing peptides that specifically bind antibodies, so that the peptide sequence motifs expressed by the phage can help to define the epitopes of the antibodies. It is often desirable to screen antibody-selected phage for binding of the selecting antibody in an immunoassay in order to verify the specificity of the interaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, for many antibodies, the best techniques for measuring specific, high affinity interactions are immuno-precipitation assays. Immuno-precipitation was therefore investigated as a means of measuring interactions between antibodies and phage clones selected from random peptide display libraries. Three mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for glutamic acid decarboxylase were used to select peptides as 9-mers on T7 phage, linear 12-mers on pIII of M13 phage, or constrained 15-mers on pVIII of M13 phage. Following the cloning and sequencing of selected phage, mixtures of antibody and phage were incubated in solution and the immune complexes were precipitated with Protein G bound to Sepharose beads. In order to detect and quantitate the phage that had formed immune complexes and been precipitated, advantage was taken of the biological properties of the phage by inducing infection of Escherichia coli by the precipitated phage. The aim was to quantitate the phage precipitated by determining the number of plaques produced, which would therefore be proportional to the degree of interaction between the phage and the antibody in solution. The results presented here indicate that this method of measuring monoclonal antibody interactions with phage selected for expression of peptides recognised by the monoclonal antibody is highly specific and sensitive.')\n",

Normal intestinal myofibroblasts released predominantly TGF-beta(3) and ulcerative colitis myofibroblasts expressed both TGF-beta(1) and TGF-beta(3), whereas in myofibroblast cultures from fibrotic Crohn's disease tissue, there was significantly lower expression of TGF-beta(3) but enhanced release of TGF-beta(2). These distinctive patterns of TGF-beta isoform release were sustained through several myofibroblast passages. Proliferation of Crohn's disease myofibroblasts was significantly greater than that of myofibroblasts derived from normal and ulcerative colitis tissue. In contrast to cells from normal and ulcerative colitis tissue, neutralization of the three TGF-beta isoforms did not affect the proliferation of Crohn's disease intestinal myofibroblasts. Studies on the effect of recombinant TGF-beta isoforms on epithelial restitution and proliferation suggest that TGF-beta(2) may be the least effective of the three isoforms in intestinal wound repair. In conclusion, the enhanced release of TGF-beta(2) but reduced expression of TGF-beta(3) by Crohn's disease intestinal myofibroblasts, together with their enhanced proliferative capacity, may lead to the development of intestinal strictures.\")\n",

The MS1 gene is expressed at low levels in anthers from closed buds, with expression in the tapetum at the stage of microspore release. No expression is seen in open flowers. The deduced MS1 protein sequence shows strong homology to the PHD-finger motif found in known transcription factors from humans, yeast and higher plants. Six alleles of ms1 have been identified; all result in premature termination of the MS1 protein and loss of the PHD-finger motif.

A greater proportion of the liver tetramer-positive cells expressed the activation marker CD69, compared with those in the periphery or other CD8(+) cells in the liver.

The project describes the preparation of an aqueous 'urine' sample, the design of a report form, the dispatch of the sample and report forms to the ward/clinic/health centre, the receipt and scoring of the returned results, and the assessment of the results, both in terms of management information and sources of error. Samples were spiked to give a target value midway between two colour blocks for each analyte. Results were scored as +/- 1 if adjacent colour block to the target, +/- 2 for results two colour blocks (error) and +/- 3 (gross error) for results three or more colour blocks from the target value. For urine glucose, results showed an overall 14.7% error and 2.6% gross error rate. Similar scoring gave the following error and gross error rates for the other analytes: bilirubin (1.0%, 3.3%); ketone (4.3%, 0.3%); specific gravity (13.4%, 3.1%); pH (11.2%, 6.5%); blood (7.7%, 2.9%); protein (9.7%, 2.3%); and nitrite (gross errors 4.9%). Investigation of the results of the programme showed four types of error in dipstick testing-timing, misalignment, misunderstanding and transcription. Analysis of the results showed a reduction in error rates when an electronic reader was used (errors 2.0%, gross errors 0.75%), compared to reading against the colour blocks on the side of the bottle (7.7%, 1.6%) or using the colour blocks on a flat card reader (7.4%, 1.7%).

It is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in TNF receptor superfamily 1A gene localised to exons encoding the ectodomain of the p55 TNF receptor, TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of cell surface TNFR1 in TRAPS, and the contribution of TNF-dependent and TNF-independent mechanisms to the production of cytokines. HEK-293 and SK-HEP-1 cell lines were stably transfected with WT or TRAPS-associated variants of human TNF receptor superfamily 1A gene. An anti-TNFR1 single domain antibody (dAb), and an anti-TNFR1 mAb, bound to cell surface WT and variant TNFR1s. In HEK-293 cells transfected with death domain-inactivated (R347A) TNFR1, and in SK-HEP-1 cells transfected with normal (full-length) TNFR1, cytokine production stimulated in the absence of exogenous TNF by the presence of certain TNFR1 variants was not inhibited by the anti-TNFR1 dAb. In SK-Hep-1 cells, specific TRAPS mutations increased the level of cytokine response to TNF, compared to WT, and this augmented cytokine production was suppressed by the anti-TNFR1 dAb. Thus, TRAPS-associated variants of TNFR1 enhance cytokine production by a TNF-independent mechanism and by sensitising cells to a TNF-dependent stimulation. The TNF-dependent mechanism requires cell surface expression of TNFR1, as this is blocked by TNFR1-specific dAb.')\n",

Expression of NK1R and SP in T cells was upregulated by IL-23 but a trend was observed with IL-12. The IL-23 effect likely involves IL-17 production that additionally mediates IL-23 effects. Mutual interactions exist with SP enhancing the cytokines IL-23 and IL-12, and SP and NK1R expression being differentially but potentially synergistically regulated by these cytokines. These findings suggest a proinflammatory role for SP in autoimmune inflammation. We propose a model whereby immunocyte derived SP stimulates Th1 and Th17 autoreactive cells migrating to the central nervous system (CNS), enhances their crossing the blood brain barrier and perpetuates inflammation in the CNS by being released from damaged nerves and activating both resident glia and infiltrating immune cells.

Our aim was to understand the extent of signaling pathway perturbation in TRAPS.

Conversely a new generation of Component Resolved Diagnostic systems using pure proteins is highly specific and totally dependent on the availability of the protein in its recombinant or natural origin form. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a microarray test based on protein extracts of food components. Our approach relies on innovations on three different fronts: the novelty of using arrayed food samples sequentially extracted with detergent and chaotropic agents, the ability to measure four different Ig classes simultaneously and the ability to analyse the generated data via a suitable bioinformatics/statistical analysis interface. This approach combines high numerical power of microarrays with automation, high throughput analysis and enables detailed investigation of the Ig profiles to food antigens. The prototype shown contains extracts of approximately 350 food ingredients that cover most of the food products found in the UK. Here we showed that the use of a sequential extraction technique to solubilise and then denature food samples has its benefits in the assessment of variations in antigenicity when tested with human sera. A patient dependent degree of class specificity was observed with human sera (IgG specificity correlates well with IgA>IgM>IgE). Besides generating a simultaneous profile for IgA, IgM, IgG and IgE the array system has shown good discrimination between challenge responders in atopic and non-atopic individuals.

      "('AbstractText', \"Cervical carcinogenesis is a multistep process initiated by 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs), most commonly HPV 16. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits epithelial proliferation and down-regulates transcription of E6/E7 genes of HPV. Altered TGF-beta expression may be important in carcinogenesis. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to investigate TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3 mRNA levels in nine specimens of normal cervix and 15 cervical precancers (eight HPV-positive, including five HPV 16-positive). Immunocytochemical expression of TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3 was examined in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) positive for HPV 16 (26), and in HPV-negative, normal ectocervical epithelium (9); reserve cell hyperplasia (12); and immature (7) and mature (15) squamous metaplasia. The intensity of staining for TGF-beta1 was measured using grey-scale image analysis. Microdissection was used to investigate epithelial and stromal (excluding crypts) levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA in HPV 16-positive cervical precancer. Normal cervix, including reserve cells and immature and mature metaplasia, showed strong immunocytochemical expression of all TGF-beta isoforms. Expression was decreased in the basal third of the epithelium in CIN 1, in the basal and middle thirds in CIN 2, and in all layers in CIN 3. Quantitative analysis of TGF-beta1 expression showed that the changes in CIN compared with normal ectocervix and mature metaplasia were statistically highly significant (p<0.001, ANOVA). TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3 mRNA levels showed a significant decrease only in the five HPV 16-positive CIN samples when compared with normal (p=0. 0034, 0.0033, and 0.029, respectively). TGF-beta mRNA levels in HPV 16-positive epithelium also decreased from normal through low-grade to high-grade precancer. Stromal TGF-beta1 was absent or very low compared with epithelial production and was not altered in HPV 16 precancer. Progressive loss of epithelial TGF-beta expression and synthesis may be important in HPV 16-associated human cervical carcinogenesis.\")\n",

      "('AbstractText', \"The need for quality assurance (QA) programmes covering near-patient testing technologies has been acknowledged since the mid-1980s. However, most effort has been directed towards capillary blood glucose monitoring techniques. The most common biochemical near-patient testing device is the dry reagent strip or 'dipstick' for urinalysis. This report describes a quality assurance programme for urinalysis, used in the wards and clinics of a district general hospital, and in some of the general practitioner surgeries within its catchment area. The project describes the preparation of an aqueous 'urine' sample, the design of a report form, the dispatch of the sample and report forms to the ward/clinic/health centre, the receipt and scoring of the returned results, and the assessment of the results, both in terms of management information and sources of error. Samples were spiked to give a target value midway between two colour blocks for each analyte. Results were scored as +/- 1 if adjacent colour block to the target, +/- 2 for results two colour blocks (error) and +/- 3 (gross error) for results three or more colour blocks from the target value. For urine glucose, results showed an overall 14.7% error and 2.6% gross error rate. Similar scoring gave the following error and gross error rates for the other analytes: bilirubin (1.0%, 3.3%); ketone (4.3%, 0.3%); specific gravity (13.4%, 3.1%); pH (11.2%, 6.5%); blood (7.7%, 2.9%); protein (9.7%, 2.3%); and nitrite (gross errors 4.9%). Investigation of the results of the programme showed four types of error in dipstick testing-timing, misalignment, misunderstanding and transcription. Analysis of the results showed a reduction in error rates when an electronic reader was used (errors 2.0%, gross errors 0.75%), compared to reading against the colour blocks on the side of the bottle (7.7%, 1.6%) or using the colour blocks on a flat card reader (7.4%, 1.7%). The report demonstrates the importance of a QA scheme in providing a reliable screening service. It gives confidence to the users of dipsticks, information on training needs to clinical managers, and an understanding of both types of error and how they can be reduced.\")\n",

To begin a precise study of the ontogeny of the marsupial Didelphis albiventris we have used cross-reactive polyclonal antibodies raised against evolutionarily highly conserved peptides which form part of the antigen specific receptor complexes of human differentiated lymphocytes. Moreover, because of antigen receptor conservation, the antibodies also recognise specifically the immunocompetent T and B lymphocytes of other species including those in the organs of the opossum. Use of the antipeptide antibodies together with other cross-reacting antibodies has allowed us to study the cellular immunology of T and B cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) during the development of thymus, skin, lymph nodes and spleen in the Brazilian white-belly opossum. The molecular nature and identity of the T cell antigens detected in opossum tissues were confirmed by immunoblotting. These findings indicate that it is now possible to exploit these antibody probes for comparative mammalian studies, and indeed to investigate interesting features of the opossum, such as reaction of the immature immune system of the pouch young to antigenic stimulation.')\n",
